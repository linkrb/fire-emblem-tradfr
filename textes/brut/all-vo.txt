[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150]Boss![A]
The residents of the castle have
hidden themselves inside![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x137]Heh, even Eliwood, the greatest
knight in Lycia, can't beat an[A]
illness, eh?[A][OpenMidRight]Hehehe..[A]
You were right when you said[A]
there wouldn't be many soldiers
around here because they're[A]
getting ready to take on Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, who do you think
I am?[A]
But you never know when
reinforcements are going to come.[A]
All right![A]
Kill off the guys in the castle
while we still got time![A]
Then the treasure is all ours![A]
[02]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151]Hehe, castles ain't the only
places with treasure.[A]
Let's go ransack the villages
and get some loot![A]
[03]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x156][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Eliwood![A]
The bandits from Bolm Mountain
are attacking us![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see... Blast![A]
If I weren't in this state,
I would teach them a lesson...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122][NormalPrint]Mister Eliwood...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina, you must hide somewhere.[A]
This castle is going to become
a battlefield.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]No, sir.
I will fight, too![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't be ridiculous.[A]
If something happened to you, I
wouldn't know what to say[A]
to Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]To my father?
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It's going to be all right.[A]
Roy should be almost here by now,
so if we can hold our own until[A]
then, we can drive off these bandits.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[04]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus![A]
I want you to send a messenger
to Roy informing him of this[A]
attack immediately![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Y-Yes sir![A][ClearFace]
[05]

[06]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?[A]
Why are you in such a hurry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy![A]
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118]WHAT!
Is Lord Eliwood safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attacks.[A]
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x109][NormalPrint]Excuse me, Lance, is it?[.....]
Is Lady Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you from Ostia?[A]
Lady Lilina is in the castle.[A]
She should be all right,[A]
as long as Lord Eliwood is with her,
but he can't last forever.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]No...[A]
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][FastPrint]Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must recapture the castle![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x11C]Wolt is right.
We must hurry![A][OpenRight][NormalPrint]Yeah.
You're right.[A][Clear]
[FastPrint][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]All right, let's go![A]
We're going to save those trapped
in the castle![A]
[07]

[08]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x137][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Dammit!
Reinforcements already?![A]
But they ain't gettin' to
the castle so easy![A]
[09]

[0A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hey hey![A]
Aren't you knights going to the
castle?[A]
This may not be much...[A]
But this is something we'd
really like to offer you.[A]
Please use it well![A]
[0B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F][CloseSpeechFast]It's awful...[A]
Soldiers from Bern were able
to cross the border...[A]
They laid an awful attack.[A]
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...[A]
He can no longer stand too well...[A]
[0C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x164][CloseSpeechFast]Hey![A]
If you wanna do well in battle
you better use the terrain wisely.[A]
Like if you're in a forest,
the trees will cover you![A]
There's no way enemies will have
an easy time in that situation.[A]

[0D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D][ToggleSmile]YOU! Guess what?[A]
Money is important![A]
If you don't have it,
your weapons will rust[A]
and you can't fight
without your weapons![A]
[0E]
[LoadFace][0x137][ToggleSmile]You damn idiots![A][Clear]
Can't you guys take on
these dastards?![A]
[0F]
[LoadFace][0x137][ToggleSmile]Wh.. What the..?!
S... Strong...[A]
[10]

[11]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Father![.....]
Lilina![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x156][ToggleSmile]Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122]Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Father!
Lilina![.....][A]
...
Thank goodness you're all right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Roy, thanks for
coming this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, father.
How is your health?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.
I'm still alive, see?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]But Roy, you do know why
I called you back here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am to take over your role of
leading Pherae's military and join[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
As you know, Bern has started
to conquer Lycia.[A]
We must follow the ancient rule and
send out our military to protect[A]
the land of Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I really didn't want to send you
out because you were still studying,[A]
but I'm not well... I would only
be a hindrance to everyone else.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Father...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Mister Eliwood,
I will accompany Roy![A]
My father is in charge of
Lycia's main army.[A]
And I could use my magic to be
of some help to Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]No, Lilina.
You must return to Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x122][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... Why?[A][.....]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]With Hector's absence, there is no one
currently sitting on the throne of Ostia.[A]
The people must be feeling uptight as well.[A]
You, being the daughter of the marquess,
must take the throne until Hector returns[A]
and ease the tension of the people.[A]
Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... No, sir.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Roy, first you must go to the Bern border
and meet with the mercenary group that[A]
I have arranged a contract with.[A]
I'll send Merlinus along with you...[.....][A]
He'll be very helpful with his knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for everything,
father.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You'll be fine.
You can do it![A]
Go and fight, and show them who you
are, the next Marquess of Pherae![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes![A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[12]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I have something to ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I know, my lady.[A]
I will accompany Roy in his travels
and swear to protect him with my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you, Bors.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[13]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][.....]Roy, be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know.[.....]
You too, Lilina.[A]
[14]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight]Roy, today I will instruct you
on basic battle tactics.[A]
[15]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
First, look at this.[A]
[Clear]
Do you see the moving square?[A]
[Clear]
This is the cursor.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][Clear]
You move your cursor to give out
commands to yourself and your allies.[A][.....]
Do you understand?[A]
Good, then let's get started.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions,[A]
But the best way to learn is to
actually experience a battle.[A]
Just try moving around for now.
I'll be here and give you advice as needed.[A]
[16]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]First, I'll tell you how to
win a battle. To win, you,[A]
Roy, have to capture the
the enemy's main defense[A]
point. That could be a castle
gate, a throne, or anywhere[A]
that the enemy leader is
positioned. For this session...[A][.....]
[17]
[LoadFace][0x134]...You must capture the castle gate,
where the cursor is at right now.[A]
I'll tell you how to capture
positions later, so make your way[A]
toward the castle gate. I'll
teach you how to move yourself[A]
around the map.[A]
[18]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]Do you see the unit in blue in the
top left? The blue units are those[A]
units are those on your side.[A]
"Units" are the people that
actually move around the map[A]
and fight.[A]
The red units are those on the
enemy side. All right then,[A]
let's try moving. You can
use the direction pad to[A]
to move your cursor around.
For now, it's positioned[A]
on you, so just press A.[A]
[19]
The area in blue is the
area in which
you can move. Use your[A]
cursor to select[A]
where you want to go,[A]
and press A to
move. If you change your[A]
mind, you can[A]
press B to cancel.[A]
Most things can be
cancelled by pressing B,[A]
so keep that[A]
in mind.[A]
[1A]
See the red area outside[A]
the blue zone?
The red zone indicates[A]
the area in which[A]
you can attack. Well, it[A]
seems that there
is an enemy unit in the red zone.[A]
[1B]
If you want to attack him,
you have to move a space next[A]
to the enemy unit. Select a
space and press A.[A]
[1C]
You can attack the[A]
enemy by selecting
"Attack" and pressing A.[A]
[1D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]If the enemy is still standing after
your attack, he'll retaliate. If one[A]
of you is particularly faster than
the other, you'll do a second attack.[A]
[1E]
Look at the red zone,[A]
or the attack range.
For you it was only[A]
one space, but now it's[A]
two spaces. That's because[A]
Wolt can attack
from distance with his bow.[A]
Indirect attacks[A]
are those done from a[A]
distance, and direct
attacks are those done[A]
right next to the enemy.[A]
Different weapons have different[A]
methods of attack.[A]
[1F]
Right now, you can do an
indirect attack with your bow.[A]
[20]
To launch an indirect attack,
you have to be one[A]
space away from[A]
your opponent. Try[A]
moving to one
of the spaces.[A]
[21]
Select "Attack" from
the menu and attack.[A]
[22]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
That was an indirect[A]
attack with a bow.
If you indirectly attack[A]
an enemy that has[A]
only close-range methods[A]
of combat, you
can hit him freely without[A]
fear of retaliation.[A]
However, on the downside,[A]
bows can't retaliate
against direct attacks.[A]
Don't forget that.[A]
[23]
Weapons like magic[A]
and Javelins can do
both direct and indirect[A]
attacks. You[A]
can see that the red[A]
zone is extended.[A]
[24]
Right now, you can launch
an attack with magic.[A]
[25]
You can either attack directly,
or keep your distance with magic.[A]
[26]
Select "Attack" to attack your opponent.
Also, do you remember the[A]
R button's function?[A]
You can hit R to see[A]
help messages here, too.[A]
[27]

[28]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]That was a magic attack.
You can attack from[A]
a distance to[A]
avoid retaliation from[A]
direct attacks,
and you can also go up[A]
close to avoid[A]
retaliation from bows.[A]
Isn't magic convenient?[A]
[29]
Choose which weapon to equip.[A]
[2A]
Choose which enemy to attack.
If there are multiple[A]
enemies in your[A]
attack range, use[A]
your cursor to
select the enemy you[A]
want to attack.[A]
For now, there's only[A]
one enemy,
so just press A.[A]
[2B]
Now, press A to attack![A]
[2C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
If you take a hit,[A]
your HP will be reduced.
HP indicates the life[A]
of a unit.[A]
If a unit's HP is[A]
reduced to zero,
that unit will die.[A]
Once a unit dies,[A]
he's gone for good.[A]
Also, if you die,
Roy, the battle is lost.[A]
Game over. So be careful.[A]
[2D]

[2E]
Do you see the "Visit" command?
If you select it[A]
and press A,[A]
you can visit the village.[A]
[2F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]If you visit villages,
you can gain items and money.[A]
You can use the items you
obtain with the "Item" command.[A]
[30]

[31]

[32]

[33]
[OpenMidRight]This is the status[A]
of this unit.
There are lots of them,[A]
like Strength[A]
and Skill, but I don't[A]
want to bore you
by explaining each one.[A]
If you want to know[A]
about them, press R to[A]
see the help message.
[Clear]All right, press B to return[A]
to the map...[A]
Oh, one more thing. If[A]
you hit the right and
left buttons on this[A]
screen, you can view[A]
more information about[A]
the unit, like his
items and skills.[A]
When you're done,[A]
press B to return to the map.[A]
[34]

[35]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]When the enemy's turn is done,
it's your turn again.[A]
The battle proceeds like this
in a turn-by-turn fashion.[A]
[36]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
All right,
I'm going to help Master Roy with my bow![A]
[37]
[LoadFace][0x134]Roy, Wolt came to help you.
You're not the only unit[A]
you can move.[A]
You have command over all[A]
of your allies,
but also remember that you[A]
are responsible[A]
for their lives.[A]
And one more thing...[......][A]
[38]
[LoadFace][0x134]Do you see where the cursor is?
This is the entrance[A]
to a village.[A]
Ordinary people live here,
so you have to inform them that[A]
a battle is going on.[A]
Move to the[A]
village and select
"Visit" to tell them.[A]
[39]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]Roy, are you all right?
I'll help you with my magic![A]
[3A]

[3B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Do you think have a[A]
good grasp on battle now?[A]
All right, now I'll tell[A]
you about a very[A]
important weapon...[A]
information. Almost
anywhere, you can[A]
press R to view help[A]
messages about things.[A]
For example, you can
move the cursor to a[A]
unit and press R to[A]
view his personal data.[A]
You can also press
R on the "Attack" and[A]
"End" commands to see[A]
help messages about them.[A]
If there's something
you're unsure of, just press R.[A]
[3C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134]
We're approaching[A]
the castle.[A]
Like I said before,[A]
you have to
capture the castle[A]
gate, where the[A]
enemy leader is[A]
positioned. Right
now it's Bors, so[A]
you have to go[A]
up and defeat him. Then,[A]
you have
to use the "Capture" command[A]
to win the battle.[A]
[3D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Good! You defeated[A]
the enemy leader.[A]
Now Roy has to move to the castle
gate and "Capture" it.[A]
[3E]
Do you see the "Capture" command?
Select it and press[A]
A to win the battle.[A]
[3F]
The "Rescue" command[A]
allows you to carry
your allies to protect[A]
them from harm.[A]
You can only rescue[A]
units that have a
lower Constitution than[A]
you. You can see[A]
your Constitution and[A]
Rescue statistics on
your personal data screen.[A]
When you rescue[A]
a unit, you can release[A]
them do a space
next to you by selecting[A]
the "Release"[A]
command. You can't do[A]
both at once, though.[A]
[40]
The "Trade" command[A]
allows you to trade
items with units next[A]
to you. If you[A]
select the command[A]
and press A, each
unit's inventory will[A]
be displayed. You[A]
select which items you[A]
want to trade with
the A button. If you[A]
just want to give or[A]
take items, trade the[A]
item with an empty
space. If you give all[A]
your weapons to[A]
another unit, you won't[A]
be able to fight,
so be careful.[A]
[41]

[42]
This is the unit menu.[A]
These are commands
that you can give to[A]
your units.[A]
Right now,[A]
the "Item" and "End" commands
are showing.
You can select which command[A]
to issue with[A]
the A button. The "Item" command
allows you[A]
to equip and use items.[A]
You can also discard[A]
items. If there's nothing to do,
select "End"[A]
to end that unit's turn. You can cancel using[A]
the B button.[A]
[43]

[44]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
How are you doing?[A]
I'll tell you about the map menu now.
Move the cursor to an empty space[A]
and press A. You can see what each
command does by using the R button.[A]
[45]
If you press A when the[A]
cursor is on an unoccupied space,[A]
the map menu appears. For now,[A]
look at the bottom command.[A]
You can choose "End" to end your[A]
phase before moving[A]
all of your units. Just select it and[A]
press A. If you want to return[A]
to the map, press B.[A]
[46]
[LoadFace][0x134]Roy...! How could you die?[A]
...Is what I would be saying if
this was a real battle.[A]
the battle is lost.[A]
Don't be discouraged...
we'll try again tomorrow.[A]
Let's go back and get some rest.[A]
[47]
[LoadFace][0x122]
Roy... If this was a real battle,[A]
I would be dead. Be careful in a
real fight, okay...?[A]
[48]
[LoadFace][0x10B]
M-Master Roy...[A]
This is only a training session,[A]
so I'm fine, but if this were[A]
a real battle, I would be dead.
Dead allies are gone forever,[A]
so please bare that in mind.[A]
[49]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
Thank you. Please don't forget to[A]
inform the villagers when a real
battle occurs as well.[A]
[4A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Good, you've captured
the castle gate.[A]
That's the end of our
session for today.[A]
How did it feel?[A]
If you ever get caught
up in a real battle,[A]
just remember what
you learned.[A]
You'll be just fine.[A]
[4B]
[LoadFace][0x109]Ah, so you have made it here.
This is a training session,[A]
but a battle all the same.
I won't go easy on you![A]
[4C]
[LoadFace][0x109]W-Well... Very good.[A]
[4D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What I'm asking is where
the princess is![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-Yes Captain Miledy...[A]
I'm certain she was in her
room this morning.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]I've already heard that![A]

What I want to know is where the
the princess is at this moment![A][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Um... She's... Er...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We're almost going into
head on war with Lycia.[A]
What if something happens
to the princess?[A]
Can you take responsibility?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I never should have let her[.....]
Highness go down to the border[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]in the first place.[A]
I will return to Bern and inform
the king about this matter.[A]
I'll try not to make it into
a panic, so you must find the[A]
princess as soon as possible.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes ma'am![A]
[4E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Is Princess Guinevere
still with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir, she's under constant
monitoring in the basement room.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good.
Don't let her escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir...
Are you sure this is[A]
a good idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Don't worry![A]
Bern has plenty of enemies.[A]
The younger sister of King Zephiel...[A]
We'll be sure to get a hefty amount
of money by turning her in to one[A]
of their foes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We're not going to make it anywhere
by serving our country, anyway,[A]
so we're better off thinking of ways
to make money fast, no?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course sir.[A]
... But, there is one little
problem with that plan...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just received a report...
it seems that Princess Guinevere's[A]
servant has escaped...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?! [.....]You fool, why didn't[.....]
you say so earlier?[A][Clear]
Go search for her immediately![.....]
Don't let her get away![A]
[4F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,
it's around here somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is where we're supposed
to meet the mercenary band?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, though, it seems[A]
they aren't here yet.[A]
[Clear]Oh wait, I can see somebody
[.....]running this way...[A]

[50]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]
Watch out![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, excuse me!
I was in a hurry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
I'm fine, but are you okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's good that you're
not hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... You are from Lycia,
are you not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I am the son of the
Marquess of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Dear God!
I thank you for your guidance![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Please, could you help
me rescue my mistress?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened?[A]
[OpenRight]My mistress and I were
traveling to meet someone[A]
from the Lycia Alliance.[A]
However, while we were passing
through here, we fell into a[A]
a trap set by Rude, the lord
of the castle just east of here.[A]
We were captured.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]
Master Roy![A]
We must not get into unnecessary
entanglements with Bern now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But we can't neglect a person who has
come to meet someone from the Alliance.[A]
... But, it isn't smart to charge
into enemy fields either...[A][Clear]
...![A]
[51]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[ToggleSmile]There they are![.....][A]
Hey guys, over here!
Get the servant girl![A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't matter whether
she's dead or alive![A]
[52]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]Oh, no...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
Well, Merlinus, they attacked first.
We have to fight, don't we?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You won't pay heed of me,
now will you?[A]
I guess I can be witness to how
much you have learned in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Alright!
We're going to charge the castle![A]
Miss Ellen, you can
hide some place safe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F]No, I will accompany you.[A]
I cannot fight, but I
can heal wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Oh...
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm the one that got you
tangled up in this mess.[A]
Please let me be of some help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, but please
don't strain yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, thank you
for your consideration.[A]
[53]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][ToggleSmile]They should be around
here somewhere...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Thany, [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]could you go and check to see
if the Pherae Army is around here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure![A]
[54]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Dieck, who's our
client this time?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Pherae family,[.....]
one of the nobles of Lycia.[A]
The marquess's son is going to
join the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][ToggleSmile]So we're going up
against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]That's what it looks like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][FastPrint]A worthy opponent!
Time to show some skill, eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][ToggleSmile]Bern... this one's going to be tough.
Better be careful.[A]
[55]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I think I've found them!
[ToggleSmile]But it looks like they're[A]
fighting somebody down there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What, a battle's[.....]
already started?[A]
We better hurry![A]
[56]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you Roy
of the Pherae family?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm Dieck.[A]
I think you've heard the news
from an old guy named Merlinus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're the leader
of the mercenary band?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]It's just a little group, really.
I'm sorry we're late,[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I didn't think that a
battle was already going on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well...
We have our issues...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No no, we're not blaming
you for it.[A]
Actually, everyone's all excited
and saying that they can show[A]
off their skills already.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thank you.
That is encouraging to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]All right then, let's get
this battle over with, shall we?[A]
[57]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]Welcome![A]
I don't have much to say,
for I am not that cool...[A]
But beware of Pegasi
and arrows![A]
They can take them down
in a single hit![A]
[58]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]Oh, you really saved us!
If those people got into our village,[A]
I don't know what would have
happened to this precious sword![A]
I was really scared...[A]
[59]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x165]A bow has great power
against flying enemies.[A]
If they get close,
you can tear 'em apart![A]
[5A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]The three weapons...
Swords, axes and spears.[A]
Remember, boy, swords beat axes,
axes beat spears,[A]
and spears beat swords![A]
Just remember that and
you will have an easy time![A]
[5B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]The forts are the key to this kingdom's defense.
If you're there, it's much easier.[A]
The enemy will miss easily,[A]
and the damage will be reduced.
Also, your wounds are slightly healed.[A]
[5C]
[LoadFace][0x138][ToggleSmile]Damn![A]
Just when I thought
luck was with me...[A]
[5D]
[LoadFace][0x138][ToggleSmile]Ugh... Greed... Only...
Brings you ill fate...[A]
[5E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
We have rescued a lady trapped
in the basement![A]
[OpenRight]That must be Ellen's mistress.
Have her come here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[ToggleSmile][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]
[5F]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10F]Your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen!
Oh, are you all right?[A]
[ToggleSmile]I never thought you would
do such a brave thing for me...[A]
You had me worried, Ellen.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I wanted to rescue you
no matter what... So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is fine, Ellen.
Thanks to you, I am safe now.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[60]
[OpenMidLeft]I am in your debt.
May I ask your name..?[A]
[OpenRight]I am Roy, son of Eliwood,
the Marquess of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
And I am...[A]
[61]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]Your Highness...
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is all right, Ellen.
My name is...[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[62]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Guinevere.[A]
[OpenRight]Guinevere?!
That's impossible![A]
That's the name of the
Princess of Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is who I am.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]What![A]
[.....]Do you plan on
attacking us now!?[A]
[OpenRight]Merlinus, wait a second.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]I beg your pardon,
Lord Roy, but...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I want to speak with her.
Give me some time, will you?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Hmph, if Master Roy says so...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]You are indeed
Princess Guinevere from Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I am not sure if you will
believe me, however.[A]
[OpenRight]Even if you are not the
Princess of Bern, I can tell from[A]
your actions and your dress that
you are certainly someone of high[A]
social status.[A]
But... if you are indeed
Princess Guinevere something[A]
doesn't seem right.[A]
Ellen told me you are intended to
meet someone from the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is correct.[A]
[OpenRight]Why, if you are
the Princess of Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to find a peaceful
way of ending the war.[A]
I figured if I could speak
to someone from Lycia,[A]
I could find some solution.[A]
[OpenRight]Your brother started this war.
Is it in your power to stop it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I certainly wish to stop it...
No, it must be stopped.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]... I see.[A]
Anyway, will you come with us to
meet the Lycia Alliance Army?[A]
I want to meet Lord Hector and see
what he thinks about this matter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Honestly...
You will take me?[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
If there is a possibility to avoid[A]
bloodshed and end this war,[A]
then I believe that we must try it,
no matter how small the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you![A]
Thank you... truly.[A]
[63]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][FastPrint][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty,[.....]
we have captured the enemy leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.
Bring him before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1BF]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]You...[A]
Zephiel, the King of Bern!!![A]
Damn you...![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ah, Lord Hector.[A]
I must praise your ability of putting
up such a good fight against[A]
two of our Dragon Lords.[A]
I suppose they do not call you
the leader of the Lycia Alliance[A]
for nothing.[A]
However, you were not good enough.[A]
Pray while you can,
for you end here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Bern and Lycia...
We were always on good terms with[A]
each other.[A]
Even when you took the throne,[A]
we have always paid our respects[A]
towards Bern...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Respect?
[ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous.[A]
Lycia... no, this entire continent
must go under my rule.[A]
That is the only way to
liberate this world.[A]
I lack the time to be worrying
about such trivial matters as[A]
respect.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]To liberate... this world?[A]
What do you mean...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is of no importance to you.[A]
You are going to die anyway.
Someone![A]
Take him away![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Throw Lord Hector
into the dungeon![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes sir![A][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][CloseSpeechFast]Your Majesty, I will now
return to the Sacae Plains.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, you may be on your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... One thing before I leave, your Majesty.[A]
I beg your pardon, but I do not
think that it is such a good idea[A]
to put too much trust into
sinister people...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Do you mean Idoun?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
Our soldiers call her the 'Dark Priestess'
and do not approve of her presence.[A]
I understand that she is a Shaman
of great powers, however...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brenya,[.....]
do you not have faith in me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...! Yes, of course I do,[.....]
your Majesty![A]
I just thought that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then all you do is
follow my orders.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Yes.[.....]
I will do whatever his Majesty
wishes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
'Do you not have faith in me?'
Dear, dear, the things I[A]
say sometimes...[A]
[64]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So Lord Hector is
still alive?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's for sure.[A]
I saw some of Bern's soldiers
take him into the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, was it?[A]
Do you know the inside
of Castle Araphen well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess.[A]
... Wait, are you guys planning on
going in to save Lord Hector?[A]
I wouldn't try that if I were you.[A]
The bulk of Bern's forces are gone,[A]
but there are still a decent number
of soldiers in the castle,[A]
you know?[A]
It would be suicide to try
and charge them with your army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps.[A]
But we can't afford to lose
Lord Hector.[A]
And you said that their main
forces are gone, right?[A]
Then there is a chance we could win.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Then I guess I'll go along too.
I can show you around[A]
the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?!
No, no, don't feel pressured![A]
If you could just explain what the
interior of the castle looks like...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I also want revenge against Bern.[A]
C'mon, let me go with you![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]All right.[A]
Then I'll be counting on you.[.....][A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course!
Leave locked chests and doors to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Master Roy...[A][.....]
I beg your forgiveness of my
brother's doings...[A]
I didn't think he would invade
Lycia so soon...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]My Lady, there's no point
in dwelling over the past.[A]
Please do not blame yourself.
Besides, Lycia is still intact.[A]
If we could get our leader,
Lord Hector, out of harm's way,[A][Clear]
we can unite Lycia once again
and fight![A]
We must recapture Castle Araphen for all
of our sakes... and for Lilina's[A]
sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's go![A]
[65]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1C1][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thanks for taking care of
the children, Reverend.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
We of the Elimine Church will take
good care of the orphans.[A]
And what will you do, Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm going to stay here.
I still have some things to do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see...[.....]
Please do not stress yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x167][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x166][OpenMidRight]Make sure you listen to what
the priest says, okay?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Aren't you coming with us,
Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm going to wait for Chad,
and then we'll catch up with you...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yay!
Chad's coming too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]That's right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Then I want [....]Ray[....]
to come too![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
It would be great if Ray came
back and we could all go[A]
together, wouldn't it?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x1C1][CloseSpeechFast]Children,
we must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
[OpenFarLeft]See you later,[....]
Lugh.[A]
[OpenLeft]Hurry and catch up, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Sure...
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry...[A]
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.[A]
[66]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Narshen!
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]What is causing all that noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Probably what's left of the
enemy are trying to put up a[.....][A]
fight in their last hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Your Highness,
shall we use the Dragons?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No, I do not wish to put the
Dark Priestess through any trouble.[A]
Do not worry, we can handle them
by ourselves...[A][OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Not this time, Idoun.[.....][A]
Send the Dragons back to Bern,
as we planned.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes,[....]
if his Highness wishes it to be so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I will be off to Bern soon as well.[A]
Narshen, I'm going to leave Lycia
up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... What shall I do with the remaining
forces of the Lycia Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Kill all those that
stand against us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Does that include
women and children?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[.....]Annihilate them enough so that they
would no longer even think about[A]
going against us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave that to me, sire.[.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hehehe...[A]
[67]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x139][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, I wonder what his Majesty sees
in that Idoun girl.[A]
Well, I think I'll be going as well.[A][.....]
Slater, I'm trusting this castle
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you leaving?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
One of the marquesses who turned[A]
against Lycia has a special gift
for me.[A]
He says it's a girl from Etrurian[A]
nobility or something...
Hehehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From Etruria?
She must be very beautiful, then![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, the marquess tells me she's still
young but very beautiful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would be looking forward to it
if I were you, sir.[A]
Please be careful on your
way there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You be careful too, Slater.[A]
Don't you dare get defeated[A]
by these remainders of Lycia's

If you do, I will personally
tear you apart.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Lugh, don't force yourself.[.....]
You can't hurt people, can you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Father.

[OpenFarLeft]It's all right...
I won't last much longer...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]I was taken by surprise...[A]
I never would have guessed that Bern[A]

[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Dragons!?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
The Dragons that we humans fought
in the past...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The Scouring?
I have heard of it.[A]
A long time ago, two races that
each had half of Elibe, the humans and[A]
the Dragons, fought over total control
of the continent...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Right... the "Eight Heroes"...
defeated the Dragons and led us[A]
humans... to... victory...[.....][A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How did Bern use the Dragons...?[A][OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I... have no idea... But...[A]
the Dragons had control of what
is now Bern in the past...[A]
and Hartmut, one of the Eight Heroes
... is the founder of Bern...[A]
Perhaps... the reason... lies
there...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Roy... Go to Ostia...![A]
... You must... lead what is left

[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry... in Ostia...[A]
are weapons that... are

to come to our side yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no future for us
if we are to be chained down by[A]
old, moldy traditions, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That, my friend, is a wise
way of thinking.[A]
Now, where is the gift that
you promised me?[A]
She does not seem to be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes!
I have prepared her in a separate room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She is a naive girl, you see.[A]
When I told her that I would
let her meet her brother,[A]
she came right along with us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You, over there!
Bring her here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x103]What, is this room?
Where is my brother, Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Welcome, Lady Clarine.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Narshen, one of Bern's
Three Dragon Lords.[A]
My Lady, I shall play with you
instead of your brother.[A]
[MoveRight]Hehehe...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Hahahahaha![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]?[A]
What is so amusing,
my lady?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You?
Instead of my brother?[A]
Take a good look in the mirror.[A]
Your clothing, your hair, your speech...[A]
every aspect of you completely
lacks finesse.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lacks finesse?!
Me, lacking finesse?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Comparing you and my brother is
like comparing a turkey to a peacock![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You, you vermin!![A]
Saying that I lack finesse,
of all things![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Sir Narshen, I have just received a
report that Castle Araphen has been[A]
retaken by the enemy![A]
[OpenRight]What!
What happened to Slater?[A]
[OpenLeft]Er...
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.[A]
The enemy has been reported as Roy,
son of the Marquess of Pherae.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x103][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Damn![A]
Lord Eric, lock the girl up
in some cell.[A]
I shall have much 'fun' with
her when I return![A]
You, close down the highroad leading
to Ostia.[A]
This Roy figure might pass by.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Yes sir![A]
[70]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151][NormalPrint]Heh... all this crap about Lycia
and Bern or whatever.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]People of nobility have so much
to worry about.[A]
Well, we can't complain 'cause
we make our living off of turmoil.[A]
Hehehe...[A]
[71]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]They shall pay for locking
me up in here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]... Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is someone there?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][CloseSpeechFast]I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Eric.[A]
He wants to see you.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]I refuse.[A]
I do not wish to meet with
such lower class people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]...
Just get over here.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Let go! You shall pay!
Do you know who I am?![A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Let go, I say![A]
[72]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I said,
let go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Shut up.
You won't be able to escape[A]
with all the noise you're making.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]![.....]
Then you're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I've prepared a horse for you
over there by that tree.[A]
Get on it and leave while
you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...[.....]
Why are you helping me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I have hatred against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hatred?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's none of your business.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Putting it that way only
makes me more curious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Time's running short.
Go![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[73]
[LoadFace][0x114][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[74]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][ToggleSmile]This is in the middle of a battlefield!
What was that man thinking?![A]
A proper gentleman should escort
the lady to her mansion![A]
Well, putting that aside...
I came all the way here on my own[A]
to meet my brother, and now look
at the state I'm in...[A]
What should I do now?[A]
[75]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah,[.....]
there you are![A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our forces are having trouble[.....]
out there.[A]
Take some more troops and assist
them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Didn't you hear?
I said to go help them![A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard you.
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph, not the friendliest of people.[A][.....]
Well, he's supposed to be one of the
best swordsmen out there.[A]
[76]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Pardon me,

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Who else?[A]
You are the leader of
this group, are you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]That is most convenient.[A]
All right then,
you are to protect me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you deaf?[A]
I said that you are going
to protect me from harm.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]Mind your mouth,
young lady![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Please step back.
I was not addressing you.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
Who do you think...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint]Now, now, Merlinus...[A]
It looks like she's being pursued by
the castle's soldiers.[A]
That's why she wants us to guard
her.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, yes![A]
That is correct...[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x154]
What... what impudence!
Our army isn't so lenient that[A]
we are going to take along some girl
who would be of absolutely no use![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]My name is Clarine,
not 'girl'.[A]
And I am not of no use![A]
I can use these staves to heal
wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint]So you will fight alongside us?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Yes![A]
Of course... I would certainly not
ask to be protected without doing[A]
anything in return![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you for joining![A]
We're going up against Bern,
so we need all the people we[A]
can recruit.[A]
I'm Roy.
Pleased to meet you, Clarine.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I am also pleased...[A]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph! 
I will not be friendly with you...[A]
[77]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh![.....]
You are...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What,
you're still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]"Still here"?[A]
You just abandon me in the middle
of a battlefield, and you still[A]
have the nerve to say that?!
I could have been killed![A][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then you're lucky that[A]
you're still alive.
Is there anything else you need[A]
to say to me?[A]
[OpenRight]Just a minute![A]
You are just going to
walk away after abandoning me?[A]
I do not think so.[A]
A proper gentleman should take
responsibility for his actions.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Responsibility?[.....]
What responsibility?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]If a gentleman rescues a lady,[A]
he must also escort her to her
mansion![A]
I've never heard any story from[A]
any barf of a man just abandoning
the lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What in the world
are you talking about?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Besides, do you not have a
grudge against Bern?[A]
Then you shouldn't be trying to
fight us, who are going up[A]
against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What?
Wait![.....][A]
Is that true?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]?[.....]
Is what true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Is the army that you're in
really fighting against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... the leader named
Roy or something said so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...
All right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I'm going to join your army.
Happy now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ah... I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
The most important thing is not
to fight Bern, but to protect me![A]
[78]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x166]
If you don't have a thief,
you won't be able to open[A]
chests and doors.[A]
Only a thief can use Lockpicks.
But I have a key called[A]
the Door Key, which can open
any door if anyone uses it.[A]
You should thank me.[A]
[79]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D][ToggleSmile]Everyone here is your ally.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're not about to abandon
the land in which we were[A]
born in and change sides.
[OpenMidRight]Please take this treasured sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was given to us generations ago.
A gift from the king.[A]
[7A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe this war is happening...[A]
Under Bern's leadership,
we will definitely wither.[A]
Here is something that will
help you stand longer.[A]
Think carefully before using it.[A]
[7B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x162]The mountain bandits and
pirates attack towns.[A]
Once they destroy a town,
there won't be anything left.[A]
Save the towns![A]
[7C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x164]In the Laus army,
there are mounted soldiers
who use bows.[A]
This is the nomad tribe.[A]
Everyone wants their military might
nowadays..[A]
[7D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you know the main point
of combat?[A]
There are weapons known as
Buster weapons, which defy[A]
the weapon triangle![A]
[7E]
[LoadFace][0x13A]You fools who are bound down
by old, moldy tradition![A][Clear]
I shall teach you
the ways of the world![A]

[LoadFace][0x13A]Ha...haha... Fools...[A]
There is no future for
those... who try and oppose
absolute power...[A]
[80]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
The Laus soldiers are retreating.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, good.
Tell everyone to get some rest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][.....][LoadFace][0x157]Roy...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have never guessed
that Lord Eric would turn to[A]
Bern's side.[A]
I thought the members of the[A]
Lycia Alliance had a strong
bonding to each other.[A]
Damn Bern!
Playing dirty like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I'm sorry![A]
I wasn't even thinking
about your feelings...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No... you are right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We will now proceed west towards
Ostia.[A]
But we can no longer trust the other
marquesses and now that Lord Hector[A]
has passed away, there may
no longer be a peaceful way[A]
to end this war.[A]
My lady, do you plan on returning
to Bern?[A]
If you need anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, please allow me to stay,
if it would not be a burden.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It would never be a burden!
But why do you wish to stay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My brother is wrong.[A]
He is dragging the Dragons
into a human war.[A]
If he thinks that is the way to
liberate the world, I must stop him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To liberate the world?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, he has always been talking
about liberating the world.[A]
He is saying that this war is
to do so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does he mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know...[A]
But my brother is not the kind[A]
of person that would think
about taking over the world.[A]
So he must have a very important
reason for conquering Elibe.[A]
Still, that is no excuse to cause
war, killing innocent people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere...[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]All right, then let's go on our
usual visit down to the village[A]
and gather up all the loot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, but boss, something's[A]
different today.[A]
There's an army stationed real
close to us![A]
They look like Lycia's troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lycia? Then that ain't a problem...
They gotta be the remainders[A]
of the army that got[A]
their ass kicked by Bern.[A]
Then we can beat them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, boss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, we still gotta[A]
take our precautions.
Maybe we can rake up some loot[A]
from them too![A]
All right boys,
let's take 'em on![A]

How may I help you?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Sir![A]
We wish for you to defeat
the bandits here![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Bandits?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]There's a pack of bandits that have
made their base in an old castle[A]
near the cliffs.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where are the castle guards?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]They fled once they heard
that Lycia lost to Bern...[A]
We villagers were left behind.[A]
We spend our days in fear of
bandit attacks.[A]

Please make use of the gate.[A]

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]She fled because you advanced upon us
with such a scary look on your face.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is the face I was born with![A]
Father Saul,
you were hitting on another girl.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You make it sound so evil!

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Why does that have to be tonight?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Well, putting that aside...
Did you not have something to tell me?[A]

[OpenMidRight]Hold on, you.[A]
Why don't you take this spear with you?
I think at some point a really[A]

Just a rumor, but he
bested many soldiers with[A]
this lance![A]

[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy, I will be fine.
I also wish to meet this priest.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Princess?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]The relationship between my brother and

[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces][ToggleMouthMove]Ahem... Your Highness,[A]
I wish to know the location of the
'Fire Emblem.'[A]
You have it with you,
do you not?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]!![ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]How did you know that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The Head Church in Bern informed[A]
us that the Fire Emblem
had mysteriously disappeared[A]
from the Temple of Seals.
They also informed me that you left[A]
at exactly the same time.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was sent by the Church to
confirm the truth.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Why did you take the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]... I wished to stop my brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your brother... Zephiel,
the king of Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you know what the
Fire Emblem is used for?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Fire Emblem is a key that
awakens the sword that was used[A]
to slay the mighty Dragons in the past.[A]
Or, that was what my father told me.[A]
But I am unsure about how exactly the
Fire Emblem or the sword work.[A]
However, the possibility of the Fire Emblem
falling into enemy hands seemed[A]
to worry my brother... a lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you took the Fire Emblem, hoping
that to make your brother believe[A]
it fell into enemy hands so that
he would stop his conquest?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes... but war broke out anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a representative of the
Elimine Church, I wish to ask[A]
you this:
What do you plan to do from here?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...Must I answer
at this moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Yes. I have not given up hope
of settling this war without[A]
bloodshed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
In that case, please allow me to
accompany your journey.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]I apologize, Roy.[A]
[8D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]Well, sneaking in here was fine,
but there's nothing worth stealing![A]
Hmm, the room to the north seems
to have treasure, but the[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]... Are those footsteps?[A][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1E3][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I trust everything is under control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our soldiers are stationed

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lead them into the castle

just as we did with Lord Orun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want Princess Guinevere alive.[A]

Now go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hahahaha...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The 'Silver Wolf's' granddaughter,

Bern will be sure to allow[A]
us on their side.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x12C][MoveMidRight]Hmmm...[.....]
Now this is getting interesting.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wonder.[A]
That man said he was
Lord Orun's advisor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wagner?
Does he bother you in any way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He seemed to be in control of
everything, as if he owned the place.[A]
And we can't even go near Lord Orun
because he's ill?[A]
Something seems wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm... come to think of it, you
do have a point, Master Roy.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][CloseSpeechFast]Excuse me, Master Roy.[A]
There seems to be an awful lot of
soldiers patrolling the area.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10C]I think we're being spied on.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?
No...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][CloseSpeechFast]You noticed?
Impressive.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]!?
Show yourself, intruder![A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hi![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]And... who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Aw, we can talk about me later.[A]
You know, I was overhearing that Wagner
guy's conversation in the main[A]
main hall, and they said they're
going to ambush you guys.[A]

[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Orun would never do that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, that person's dead.[A]
That dark magician assassinated
him or something.[A]
[OpenRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]And he's going to capture you
guys and turn you into Bern so[A]
they can join up with them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x154][ToggleSmile]Hold it, Master Roy![A]
Don't trust people like this
so easily![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You can believe me or not,
it's up to you.[A]
But don't come crying to me when
you find yourselves in trouble![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x157][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Roy...
If what she says is true...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's set a trap.
We'll pretend like we're leaving.[A]
if Wagner is after us, he'll do
something to persuade us to stay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you're gonna go outside,
use the room in the north![A]
That room leads to the courtyard,[A]
so you'll be out of here in
no time.[A]
Good luck![A]
[8F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1E3][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Master Roy!
Where are you going?[A]
We will escort you into the castle,[A]
so please come this way.[A]
[OpenFarRight]My apologies, sir,[A]
but I have just received a report
of a matter of importance.[A]
Excuse us, but we must be going now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh... But I surely cannot see you
off without paying my respects and[A]
offering you a place to stay!
Lord Orun would never forgive[A]
me for that![A]
Please, Master Roy, will you not
just spend one night here with us?[A][OpenFarRight]Do not worry, I shall tell Lord
Orun myself that you are[A]
not to blame.[A]
I ought to pay my respects
to him, anyway.[A]
Please show us to his room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like I said, Master Roy, Lord
Orun is ill and cannot see you.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I am sorry, sir, but if we
cannot see him, then we have[A]
have no reason to stay here.[A]
We are in a hurry.[A]
Excuse us,
but we must be off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]You are leaving...
No matter what?[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Then I have no choice but
to kill you now![A]
Everyone! Attack![A]
Kill them all, but leave
Princess Guinevere alive![A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]Damn!
So they were after us![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E]Master Roy![A]
Even if we escape this way,
we'll just be attacked from behind![A]
[OpenRight]Then we'll take over this castle!
Everyone, follow me![A]
[90]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][FastPrint]Whoo,
they're at each other's[A]
throats now.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]'Suppose I'll take what[A]
I can while I can.[A]
[91]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]All this noise...[A][Clear]
A battle?
What is going on outside?[A]
[92]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?
What's a girl doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?...
You aren't a person from the castle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who are you?
Oh, my name is Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Sue.
Are you causing the noise outside?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The noise of a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Oh yes.[A]
We're fighting denizens of
the castle.[A]
It's a long story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see.
Then I am on your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]This castle's residents are
my enemies as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What do you mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please give me a bow.[A]
I will fight alongside you.[A]
[93]
[LoadFace][0x1E3][ToggleSmile]Damn you,
useless vassals![A]
Well then,
I have no choice.[A][Clear]
Witness my magic...[A]
And bow down before
its power![A]
[94]
[LoadFace][0x1E3]
[ToggleSmile]No...[A]
My plan...
was flawless...[A]
[95]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... So you're the granddaughter of the
leader of one of the clans in Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Grandpa is the strongest warrior
in Sacae.[A]
People call him the
'Silver Wolf.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Silver Wolf...
I have heard of him.[A]
But what are you doing in Lycia?
Sacae is to the east.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern invaded Sacae, so we of the
Kutolah clan have decided to fight.[A]
So grandpa let the women and
children escape to Lycia, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There was a traitor.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]The Djute clan, who have turned
to Bern's side, ambushed us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]We were all separated.[A]
I found my way into these lands
and I was rescued by Lord Orun.[A]
But his advisor, Wagner, assassinated
Lord Orun and took over the castle.[A][OpenMidRight]And then you were captured...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is your army fighting Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Bern has invaded
our lands as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then let me go with you.[A]
Fighting Bern will let
me rescue grandpa.[A]
I also want to avenge
Lord Orun.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're headed for Ostia.[A]
It's in the opposite direction
as Sacae, so is this okay[A]
with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't mind.
No matter where we are,[A]
neither our Mother the Earth
or our Father the Sky[A]
will ever disappear.[A]
[96]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
The spy I sent to Ostia has just
returned, and he says that Ostia[A]
is in a state of chaos![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's been a rebellion among
those who want to surrender to Bern.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The spy says that she has
been taken as a hostage.[A]
Currently, the rebel group has taken
over Castle Ostia and are fighting[A]
the soldiers who wish to retake
the castle and Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We must hurry to Ostia!
Lilina, please be safe![A]
[97]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! You're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oops...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, what do you think
you're doing?[A]
Let go of my arm![A]
Ow! That hurts![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
But...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, um, you know,
it's complicated.[A]
I have things to do, you see?
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Things to do? Here?
In a battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dummy, it's because this is a
battlefield...[A]
... Whoops, better watch my tongue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have some motive
that we're unaware of?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ulp..[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that why you
told us the escape route...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, what?[A]
I have no idea what
you're talking about![A]
[OpenMidRight]Who are you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now, now, don't worry
about such trivial things![A][Clear]
Oh, I gotta go. Bye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait![A]
[98]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Crap...
Er, what a coincidence![A]
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...If you're in the battlefield
just to steal, you shouldn't be.[A]
It's not right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.[A]
I only take from the rich who
have plenty of money.[A]
No one's going to starve or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not the point.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh really?
Then let me ask you this.[A]
You nobles take food and money
from the people living in what[A]
you call your territory.[A]
Who said that was your land, anyway?[A]
And you say you're collecting
taxes, but what you're doing is[A]
the same.
Looting![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
But we protect the people
in return...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're not![A]
You're killing your own people,
causing a war like this![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well.. Bern started to invade,
so we had to fight to defend[A]
our people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you can just do anything
you want, as long as you say[A]
you're protecting us?[A]
You can burn down villages
and ruin our crops?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Burned?
We never... ![A]
Wait a minute, was your...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...My village was burned to
the ground by our marquess.[A]
He said that he had no choice
because he needed to prepare for[A]
Bern's attacks.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well... that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We always had just enough to
eat and survive, and then we[A]
just lost everything...
Our homes... our crops...[A]
And then you say not to take from
other people?[A]
Ha! You shouldn't be talking!
You dastards from the nobility[A]
take from us so you can live
in luxury while we suffer![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
don't know what to say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh. We're getting all gloomy now.[A]
I really don't like talking about
'I'm worse off so you should pity me'[A]
arguments.[A]
But you're the one who started it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, to heck with this.[A]
It's no fun stealing after a
talk like that.[A]
Well, I guess I better bail
out then.[A][Clear]
See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[99]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! You're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? ...You again?[A]
These days, you always appear
to screw up my plans.[A]
Do you have something against me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I just... wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The last time we met, I said
some pretty harsh things.[A]
Like calling you a villain when
I didn't know the things you had[A]
gone through...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that? It's okay.
It's not really bothering me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I still think what[A]
you're doing isn't right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've really got nerve to
say that, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So would you give
me a chance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Once this war is over, I'll promise to
rebuild the villages that were damaged[A]
because of it.[A]
I'll be sure to make good use of
the taxes that they pay.[A]
So until then, I'd like you
to stop stealing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...[.....]
How long would that be?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When this war is over.
I can't exactly say when...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you expect me to wait
patiently until then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
Would that be okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?
Why do you tell me this?[A]
Why do you try so hard to
help someone like me?[A]
You should just leave a burglar
like me alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Without you, we wouldn't have
been able to escape Wagner's castle.[A]
Though you probably weren't trying
to help us, you did and you saved[A]
our lives.[A]
We can't just leave our benefactor
alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well well, at the rate
you're going...[A]
I guess you'll be getting in my way,
no matter where I go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]As long as you
appear in our path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, you win.[A]
I'll stop coming to battlefields
to steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Thanks for understanding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But, you have to let
me go along with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Actions speak louder
than words.[A]
I have to see whether you're going
to be true to your words or not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right![A]
[9A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Devias, how is the city doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They've been quiet so far, sir.[A]
But the mercenary knights from Ilia that
Hector hired are showing no submission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph! What's wrong with them?
We're telling them we'll pay more![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Ilia's mercenary knights are
known never to betray their masters.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You fool![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]I know that![A]
General Narshen is going
to arrive soon![A]
If we don't have Ostia
under our control by then,[A]
he'll laugh at us![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]O-of course, sir.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]We may have to use Lilina to bargain
with the mercenary knights...[A]
If we use her as a hostage,[A]
they should surrender to us.[A]
But that must be a last resort.[A]
We will fight them ourselves with[A]
the help of Dragon Knights sent
from Bern to crush Ilia's forces!![A]
Devias, I want you to clear out the
town and guard the castle gate.[A]
I will defend the inside of our castle.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir![A]
[9B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Merlinus!
Around how many of Ostia's troops[A]
have joined the rebellion?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Quite a few, I'm afraid.[A]
They have forgotten their
loyalty towards Lord Hector,[A]
and are simply flocking towards the
one with more power, which is Bern.[A]
How disgraceful![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But there is good news too, Master Roy!
There is a band of mercenary knights[A]
from Ilia that are willing to join
forces with us and attack the rebels.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x157]Mercenary knights from Ilia?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
They said that they signed a contract
with Lord Hector that they would fight[A]
Bern alongside Ostia's troops.[A]
[OpenRight]That's fortunate.[A]
But when the mercenary knights hear the
news that Lord Hector has passed away,[A]
that contract would probably be broken.[A]
Do you think it's possible for us to
officially hire them into our service?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would have thought
so too, Master Roy.[A]
However, they already knew
of Lord Hector's death.[A]
They offered to fight
alongside us anyway.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Why do they go that far,
when they are mercenaries?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia is a snowy area with a harsh
temperature so the land isn't very arable.[A]
Therefore, sending out mercenaries[A]
to fight for pay is one of
Ilia's main sources of[A]
economic input.[A]
I've also heard that mercenaries
from Ilia put trust over anything[A]
else and that they never
betray their employers.[A]
The rumors are true, I see.[A]
[9C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It looks like the Lycia Alliance have
started attacking the rebels.[A]
All right, we're going too.[A]
Let's go and drive off
the rebel forces![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Will do, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Wait,
where's Noah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ummm, I think he went to
the arena a while ago.[A]
He said he's coaching a young
girl in the sword arts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That Noah, a coach?
That's unusual...[A]
Well, no matter.[A]
Once he finds out that
we're attacking the rebels,[A]
he'll catch up to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yup.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
let's go.[A]
[9D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.[A]
Well then, Fir, I should
get going soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for coaching
me, Sir Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No problem.
But I must say you surprised me.[A]
You suddenly came up to me
and said, "I want to fight a[A]
match with you!"[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.
It was my first time in[A]
the arena...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you asked another person,
you would have been killed.[A]
You need to look your opponent over
very carefully before choosing to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you must not hesitate to surrender
if it looks like you're going to lose.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Exactly.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]You can always win back your money,
but if you lose your life,[A]
it's all over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What are your plans now?[A]
Are you going to stay here and work
on your sword skills?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I'm planning to travel
to the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Western Isles?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They're building a new mine there,
and I heard that a lot of people[A]
are going there looking for work.[A]
They must be strong people if they're
miners, so I thought it would be the[A]
ideal place to find people to
fight for my training.[A]
And besides...[A][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Besides?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Western Isles is where my
mother first met my father.[A]
She's dead now, but when she was my
age she was also traveling around the[A]
world training her sword skills.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see...
You surprise me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]All you were saying at first was,[A]
"I want to become strong,[A]
I want to become strong", right?[A]
So I thought swordplay was all
you had interest in.[A]
But you were training because you
wanted to be like your mother?[A]
I'm so happy to see that you
do have a cute side![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? ...Sir Noah!
Please don't tease me![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hahahaha![A]
[9E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13C][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The reinforcements should be
arriving from the south soon.[A]
Hehe... That Lycia army'll be shocked
when they get hit from behind![A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...[A]
I was expecting somebody a
little older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake![A]
And Lilina's sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.
Then we'll help you[A]
as much as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come, we must concentrate on
the enemy right now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[A0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're one of the Ilian
mercenaries, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yeah.[A]
And what do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I'm the leader of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh! I heard about you...[A]
From now on, is it all right if
I join with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure
that's alright?[A][.....]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't you have to ask your
commander if it's okay..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He told us to join with
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
That's enough for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he mean like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]This is a battlefield.[.....]
If you take your time to[A]
check everything with your commander,[A]
then you won't be able to act
quickly in trouble.[A]
It's not good to disobey orders,
but outside of that you can[A]
play it by ear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see...
Thanks for telling me.[A]
[A1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][NormalPrint]Noah![OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sir Zealot,[.....]
I'm sorry that I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I heard you were coaching a
young girl in the sword arts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A][.....]
She was a little naive,
so I couldn't help it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Is she not with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She said she was headed
for the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
Pity, I thought she might have
been of some help if she were[A]
still here.
But you, who ordinarily wouldn't[A]
Start nosing around into other
people's matters, a coach?[A]
Now that is unusual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you think so, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Treck and I were joking around saying
that you may have fancied the girl.[A]
But it is in the arena, so
that probably wasn't the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[A2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Treck, we are now going into
the Lycia army's service.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm, not the most enthusiastic[.....]
response. You don't like the idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
No, I have no problem with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, all right.
Just thought I'd ask.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia...
Nah, we shouldn't have much trouble.[A]
[A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're one of the Ilian

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Hmmm?

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, then I'm going to be
under your leadership from now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What??[.....]
Is that okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You don't have to check
with your commander first?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, don't worry about that.[A]
He said we were to join with the
Lycia alliance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he really mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]"Really mean" what?
We're in the middle of a battle.[A]
If you take the time to check every
little thing with your commander,[A]
you'll be dead.[A]
I'm not going against his orders,
though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].. All right.[A]
[A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's Noah.
You were at the arena,[A]
weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
sorry I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Doesn't really matter...
We've just started fighting.[A]
I haven't talked to the Lycia
Alliance army yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Don't worry, I just got done
talking to their leader.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really![A]
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.[A]
Noah, I leave the negotiations
with the Lycia Alliance to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir![A]
[A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck,
what is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just met with the Lycia
Alliance leader.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, did you?
Why didn't you tell me, then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, not like that.
I just met with him now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's fine.[A]
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.[A]
Treck, I leave the negotiations with
the Lycian Alliance to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir![A]
[A6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][FastPrint][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, sir, are you Sir Zealot[.....]
of the Ilia Mercenary Knights?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy. I'm the leader of[.....]
the army that's fighting the rebels.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...
I was expecting somebody a little older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake![A]
And Lilina's sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right. Then we'll
help you as much as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come, we must concentrate on the
enemy right now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
Hey you, look at this great
thing I made.[A]
It fires arrows MUCH further
than a normal bow![A]
It's very useful, right?
Right. Just like I thought.[A]
I'll give it to you guys,
I want it with someone that[A]
knows how to use it.[A]
[A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
[OpenMidRight]This..? This is the Torch Staff![A]
It creates light in the foggiest places![A]
If you're in a fog, you
can't attack or see anything![A]
It helps to have this when
it works against you.[A]
[A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
[OpenMidRight]Medicine! Medicine!
This cures anything![A]
No matter what kind of wounds
you have, this will restore[A]
you completely!
The contents are a secret,[A]
though...
Can't tell you,[A]
or I'll get in trouble.
Hmm?[A]
You don't want the medicine?[A]
Aww, I'll give you some for
free, if you buy it next time![A]
[AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]
[ToggleSmile]This town used to belong to Lycia!
But now, look at it...[A]
You guys are out to restore
Ostia's former glory, right?[A]
Then, take this gem...
If you sell it,[A]
it will catch a high price!
Please, help Ostia![A]
[AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x167]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you going to help Lady Lilina?
Here's something that can cure
injures from a distance![A]
If Lady Lilina's hurt,
please help her...[A]
[AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A while back, some unknown
person was dying in the street.[A]
When I helped him, he gave me
this sword.[A]
Really strange person, but nice...
Hm? Here's the sword.[A]
You can have it!
Just take good care of it.[A]
[AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Be careful. General Leygance
is allied with Bern now![A]
He went and slaughtered all those
who resisted him...[A]
But I saved my own hide.
Please take this, it's proof
for Heroes.[A]
Give this to them, and keep
fighting to protect Ostia...[A]
[AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
Social Knights, Paladins, Nomads...
All those guys riding on horses...[A]
This spear, the Knight Killer,
is effective against them.[A]
There's alot of horsemen in
the rebel army.[A]
So use this against them![A]
[AF]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]You... you beat Bern's
Dragon Knights!?[A][Clear]
Ergh...
I'll not let you pass here![A]

[B0]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]General Leygance...
Please be careful...[A][Clear]
These people are...[......]
strong...[A]
[B1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Okay, the city should be
under control by now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Now we have to recapture
Castle Ostia and rescue Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Master Roy, we are currently breaking
down the gate to enter the castle.[A]
I understand that you want to get in
quickly, but we are working as fast[A]
as we can, so please be patient![A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Speaking of Lady Lilina...[A]
What do you think of Lord
Hector's story, Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You mean about the Dragons?
They weren't myth,[A]
they were real...[A]
Lord Hector is one of the greatest
battle tacticians in Lycia.[A]
And his army was decimated in such
a short time...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Bern's army is among
the strongest in Elibe.[A]
I say, those Dragon Knights are
indeed very formidable opponents.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course the Dragon Knights must
have been tough enemies.[A]
But the real Dragons... I can't even
imagine how powerful they must be.[A]
The weapons that are effective
against Dragons...[A]
I wonder where they are?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume they must be
the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So if we use those weapons, we
can fight the Dragons effectively.[A]
But I wonder what a Divine Weapon
is doing in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps Lady Lilina knows that.
Hmm, I do wish to know as well.[A]
Oh![A]
Master Roy, our men have finished
knocking down the gate.[A]
We can enter now![A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight]All right! Charge!
We will rescue Lilina,[A]
no matter what![A]
[B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]
[MoveMidRight]What?!
The enemy has broken into[A]
the castle?[A]
What the hell was Devias
doing out there?![A]
Were those Knights from Ilia
so strong?[A]
...Or was the Lycia army larger
than I expected...[A]
In any case, they have gotten into
the 'unconquerable' Castle Ostia![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]We must drive them out, or
Bern will look down upon us...[A]
[Clear]
You over there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Yes sir![A]
[OpenMidRight]Set up the troops all over the castle![A]
Especially around the throne room![A]
Prepare your defenses![A]
We must not let the Lycia Army
get any further into the castle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Understood sir![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]One more thing.[A]
I want you to discreetly
kill Lilina during the battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]What? ... Sir, weren't we
supposed to keep her alive?[A]
[OpenRight]I was planning on using her
as a hostage.[A]
But there are still many rebels
that put faith in her.[A]
If we openly use her as a hostage,
those soldiers might turn against us.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]But in that case sir, they would
surely turn on us if we kill her![A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]So I said to do it discreetly,
didn't I?![A]
Kill her quietly, and pretend
that she was hit by a stray arrow.[A][Clear]
Then we can make the enemy
responsible for it![A]
Now go![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, sir...[A]
[B3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][.....]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11D]...General Roy of the Lycia
Alliance Army, I presume.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]! Who are you?[.....]
An enemy?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm on your side.
Greetings, my name is Astol.[A]
I used to work here in the
service of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]Excuse me, but what kind of
work were you doing?[A]
You certainly don't look like
one of Ostia's servants...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My, my, aren't we a
little rude, old man?[A]
See, I'm a spy.[A]
I go on secret missions to gather
information, steal things,[A]
check on people...
That kind of thing.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Hmm, I see.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]If people can tell that I'm working
for a noble just by looking at me,[A]
then I'm not much of a spy, am I?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Anyway, for a month now, I've been
running around Lycia to gather the[A]
latest news.
When I heard about Lord Hector's[A]
death in Araphen, I returned here
as quickly as I could.[A]
Then I see that those idiots,[A]
Leygance and Devias have caused a
rebellion![A]
I didn't make it in time to save
Lord Hector, but I don't want to be[A]
too late for Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenRight]Then you'll join us?
Good, let's work together to[A]
rescue her.
Do you know where Lilina is?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Of course, investigating into
matters like that is my job.[A]
Lady Lilina is locked into a small
room in the center of the castle.[A]
And that dastard Leygance is sitting
on the throne like he owns the place.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to hurry then.
We must defeat the rebels and[A]
rescue Lilina before Narshen
arrives from Bern![A]
[B4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's all this noise?[A]
Is there a battle going on?[A]
I wonder what's happening outside...[A]
[B5]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x116][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth,
this is a dead end![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][CloseSpeechFast]Don't worry.
This wall has cracks in it.[A]
We can break through it if we hit
it a little with our weapons.[A]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x1BD]I wonder where
Lady Lilina is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a pretty good idea
where she is.[A]
We've known this castle for
a long time.[A]
Hmm, I do wonder what's
causing all the noise, though.[A]
[OpenRight]The Alliance Army?
Then my brother must be[A]
with them...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... We don't know if he's
still alive.[A]
You shouldn't have such
high expectations.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Oh... Yes.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Barth, you don't
have to be so cold.[A]
He's Wendy's only brother,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You must never look away
from reality.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]It's all right, Oujay.
Sir Barth is right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As an Armor Knight of Ostia,
you must never panic, no[A]
[.....]matter what the situation.
Understood, Wendy?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]...Yes.[A]
[B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C]Yes!
Just as I thought,
they're at each other again.[A]
I mean, how stupid can these
nobles get?[A]
I can never understand what the
fun is in fighting all the time.[A]
Oh well,
guess I'll swipe what I can.[A]
[B7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][NormalPrint]Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122]...Roy?[.....]
Is it really you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You came!
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank goodness you're all right.
Here, take this spell book.[A]
Use it to defend yourself for
the time being.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thanks.[A]
[B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][NormalPrint]Bors![.....]
You're all right![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][FastPrint]Why, is it Wendy?
I'm glad to see you're okay too.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...!?
What the...[A]
What are you wearing?!
Did you apply to become an Ostian[A]
Armor Knight or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Actually, I did.
I was knighted just yesterday.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What are you doing...
I thought I told you to leave the[A]
fighting to us and live your life
as you wished![A]
You didn't need to become an
Armor Knight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I thought about it, and
what I truly want is to become a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't want to just wait here
for you to return from battle.[A]
I want to become a knight
as great as you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well, you were always stubborn,
weren't you, Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You should live your life as you wish.
If Mother and Father were alive,[A]
they would say that as well.
But the way of the knight is no[A]
easy feat![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm prepared![.....]
I shall never give up![A]
[B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
Lady Lilina!
You are safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors, I am
sorry that[A]
I worried you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, my Lady!
You were alive...[A]
That in itself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors.[A]
And you kept your promise
that you would
protect Roy for me.[A]
I knew I was doing[A]
the right thing
when I asked you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, my Lady![A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barth, you were right.
Leygance was planning a rebellion.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]If I had believed you in the first
place, this wouldn't have happened...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
Lady Lilina, you do not have
anything to apologize about.[A]
The one to be prosecuted is
Leygance, who insulted your kind[A]
and trusting heart toward him.
[ToggleSmile]It is your kindness that[A]
we respect the most, my Lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Barth...[A]
[BB]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]You vermin of the

How can you fight[A]

so hard...?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]We've finally recaptured

[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Roy.[A]
I'm glad that my father didn't have
to go through the trouble.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, is my father still in Araphen?[A]
I heard it was a tough battle there,
but does it looks like it's going to[A]
take much longer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...
Haven't you heard anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector...
has passed away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry... When we arrived
at Castle Araphen...[A]
It was already under Bern's control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not your fault...
Don't apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Hector was already severely
wounded when we arrived.[A]
If only we had gotten there faster,
maybe I could have helped him...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No... it's okay.
I... was prepared for this...[A]
I'm a warrior's daughter.[A]
I've been taught not to panic
in times like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So everyone should have told me...
They're too considerate...[A]
I'm strong too, you know...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina, you don't have to
hold back in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's okay...
I'll be with you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Master Roy! Bern's Dragon Knights

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hehehe...
[ToggleMouthMove]Are you Roy?[A]
I must thank you for getting
rid of that idiot Leygance for me.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Now, you will leave Ostia
to me.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous!
Who would give Ostia to the likes[A]
of you..![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
Then do you wish to fight us

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]I shall annihilate you,

A legion has arrived from Etruria![A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]I can see that, you fool!
Why...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][FastPrint]I am Percival,
Knight General of Etruria.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Yesterday, Sorcery General Cecilia
informed me that Ostia had[A]
requested Etruria's protection.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You seem discontent.
We are prepared for battle.[A]
But can those Dragon Knights of yours
stand a chance against all of us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Cecilia,
Sorcery General of Etruria![A]
Ostia is now under our
protection.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Argh...
You...you...!!![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][CloseSpeechFast]General Narshen,
please control your temper![A]
General Percival is one of the
strongest warriors in Etruria![A]
And with General Cecilia here as well
we'll be slaughtered![A]
[OpenLeft]I know!
We're leaving![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]Cecilia, is it?
Watch your back from now on![A]
[C1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you General Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
I am in charge of the Alliance Army
in the place of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
Lycia is in a time of hardship.[A]
Our king also sends his words of
regret for Lord Hector's death.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your consideration.[A]
If Etruria hadn't helped us...
Ostia would be under Bern's control now.[A]
Thank you very much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am not the one to thank.
I simply followed my king's orders.[A]
You should thank Cecilia, who
went against the king to help you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]She...
disobeyed the king's orders?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
now isn't that something?[A]
Well, I must be off.[A]
Two of the three Etrurian Generals
shouldn't be leaving the country[A]
for so long.[A]
Cecilia,[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
[OpenMidLeft]can you take care of the rest?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Thank you, Percival.[A]
You can leave the rest to me.[A]
[C2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Whew...
General Percival...[A]
Now he's someone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][ToggleSmile]Nervous, were you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How are you doing, Roy?
You look a little tired,[A]
but you seem okay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thanks to Etruria,
we were able to avoid disaster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad we made it
here in time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A]
I put you through a lot of
trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
It's going to be beneficial for Etruria
for Ostia to go under our protection.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Beneficial?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Bern's been acting aggressively
these days, as you know.[A]
We also want to do something about it,
but since we haven't been directly[A]
invaded, we have no reason to go to[A]
war with them.[A]
But if Bern gets any stronger, the
balance of powers would be shattered.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So when Ostia requested[A]
protection, you saw it as a good
reason to declare war on Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We just did what would be
best for us.[A]
You don't need to feel that
you're in our debt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you shouldn't thank us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Understood. I won't.[A]
Well anyway, please come in and
meet the rest of our army.[A]
[C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134]... He's gotten so bold in the short

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yup. We just saw 'em arrive on

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just as that other group said...[A]
All right, they're probably
floundering around in the fog[A]
unable to see anything.
Just sneak up on them[A]
from behind and kill 'em off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss.[A]

I couldn't be of help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry about it.
It isn't your responsibility,[A]
Lady Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. But even within Etruria,
there are a lot of people voicing their[A]
discontent on how the advisor is
treating Lycia like servants.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Advisor? I thought the
king had made the decision to send Lycia[A]
to clear out the bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. Advisor Roartz had been working with[A]
Lord Arcard, who's in charge
of the mining operation in the[A]
Western Isles, and they decided to
do it on their own without[A]
consulting the king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How can they do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you remember last year's
tragedy in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.
Etruria's next heir,[A]
Prince Mildain,
suddenly passed away last year.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had the honor to meet him.[A]
I understand that he was a very
bright individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... If the prince were alive,
Etruria wouldn't be like this.[A]
King Mordred couldn't bear the fact
that his son had died.[A]
The shock was so great that he never
completely recovered from it.[A]
And today, it seems like he's always
in a different world, and he doesn't[A]
really pay attention to anything going
on around him or in his country.[A]
Roartz took advantage of this.[A][Clear]
Now, he's basically in charge
of what goes in the palace.[A]
Ever since then, he has kept the
Three Etrurian Generals,[A]
Lord Douglas, Percival, and me,
away from the king unless there's[A]
a great emergency.[A]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Fir.
Sorry I had to call you in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What is all this noise about?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well you see, some brigands
are attacking this island.[A]
The people living here are in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]What![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I sent some guys over to try and stop
them, but the invaders are pretty tough.[A]
The situation doesn't look good.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]I can't believe...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If only I could go out there...
but I can't leave the castle.[A]
So, Fir, I'm sorry,
but...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. I shall go

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave it to me!
Attacking innocent villagers...[A]
that's not forgivable![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I asked another guy too,
so you can work with him.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Someone else?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yeah, a nomad named Shin.[.....]
He looks frail, but he's got[A]
a decent shot with his bow.[A]
[CC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151][ToggleSmile]Boss, you sure? I mean,
letting a girl like that fight[A]
out there...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
Once she's killed, we can[A]
get that sword she's carrying.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sword?
That weird one she has?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's no ordinary sword.
That's the 'Wo Dao', a famous katana.[A]
If we can get it from her and sell it,
it'll be worth a fortune. Hehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
[CloseSpeechFast]So that's why you were so[A]
generous to her at first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't make a move up until
now, but now's a chance.[A]
Listen, I want you to follow her.
When you see the chance, grab[A]
the sword from her![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss![A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Um, did you also [ToggleSmile]join the fight
to protect the people living here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I have no such
interest in such things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm paid to fight.[.....]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...I gotta keep the

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... you're from Sacae,

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What took you all
the way out here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It's nothing new. You look like
you're from Sacae, and you're also here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well I'm traveling around Elibe
to train myself, and...[A]
Oh, you weren't asking about me,
were you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...Whew.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I'm looking for somebody.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Who?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...My clan lost to Bern
when they invaded Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Our clan leader let me escape,
and he told me[A]
to find and protect
his granddaughter.[A]
So I left the battlefield
to fulfill his request.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
Well, I hope you find her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]

What are you doing here?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, I joined this army
a while back... Whoa![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][ToggleSmile]What are you thinking?!
Put away your sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Noah! I thought you were
nobler than this![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just because you're
a mercenary knight...[A]
Lending your services to pirates?!
You should be ashamed![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't play dumb!
You're working with a band of[A]
pirates to attack the people
living on this island![A]
And you call yourself a knight?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um, can I have a sec? I think
there's a really big misunderstanding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misunderstanding?!
You still insist...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We're trying to help
the villagers.[A]
We're supposed to go defeat
the head of a pirate group.[A]
I think his name was Scott
or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Scott is the head
of a pirate band?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you think I'm lying, why don't
you ask the pirate over there?[A]
He's right behind you,
hiding in the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pirate?
What pirate...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151]

Wait![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You didn't suspect at
all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Scott was very
kind to me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really? Rumors say that
he's a very cruel man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, my mother used to say that you
shouldn't judge people by their looks...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, that's true,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I was lending my services
to pirates...[A]
What can I do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then you want to come
along with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?
Would it be okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We're always looking for more
people to strengthen our army.[A]
I'll talk to Roy about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you![A]

What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]For me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
That was the clan leader's orders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...What happened to
our clan after I left?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, we didn't stand
a chance against Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...We lost.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What has happened to
my grandfather?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He is continuing the
struggle against Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I was told by the clan leader
to leave and look for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then will you fight
alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]With you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We will be helping Grandfather because
this army is fighting against Bern.[A]
Also, this army saved my life
earlier.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Understood, my lady.
If that is your plan,[A]
then I am at your disposal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[D0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x187]
[ToggleSmile] This area basically belongs
to the pirates.[A]
They just steal from us
all the time.[A]
Resistance?
That's useless.[A]
They can do whatever they want
because they have lots of support.[A]
We can't fight against
them like the resistance force.[A]
[D1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18A]
[Clear]You saved us![A]
Are you with the Registrants?
No?[A]
Then you're just normal good people?
Just as you've seen, this island[A]
is swarmed with pirates and bandits![A]
But... what are we going to do?[A]
Rumors around here say there's a severe
battle going on in the west.[A]
Go ahead and tell them that
we're leaving the island...[A]
[D2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x185]
[ToggleSmile]Eh...[A]
The only people here are the
women and children.[A]
Everyone else, the workers,
have gone north to the mines.[A]
They aren't even allowed to sleep there,
they just work until they die...[A]
My brother, who escaped,
is as thin as an old man.[A]
That day, he drew his last breath.[A]
Now that I've told you this...
Can you do... er, sorry...[A]
I've said too much.
Please forget all of this.[A]
We're leaving this island now.[A]
[D3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
Geez, there's so much mist here...[A]
In these conditions, you have NO idea,
if anyone is lurking around![A]
The Torch Staff is useful, even for
those hard-eyed thieves.[A]
[D4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
The resistance is doing quite well.[A]
In the north, and in the east--
they're always in the thick[A]
of battle.
Which way will you go?[A]
[D5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x186]
Among the pirates is a very
skilled nomad...[A]
Even though you can't see him
at all in the mist...[A]
They're horse-riding people,
but this guy also has a girl[A]
with him...[A]
[D6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
The nearby villages...
Everyone in them are leaving[A]
the islands.
It's very sad, really.[A]
If you want to visit, you'd
better do it quickly.[A]
You don't have time to go to both,
so you'll have to decide.[A]
[D7]
[LoadFace][0x13E][ToggleSmile]So the fog didn't
[ToggleSmile]stop you after all...[A]
But you gotta be pretty[A]
beat up by now!
I'll finish you off![A]
[D8]
[LoadFace][0x13E][ToggleSmile]Who the hell...
are you?[A]
You're no ordinary army..[A]
[D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, it looked like the
enemy was trying to ambush us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They must have known
we were coming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Something must be going on
behind the scenes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. Clearing out the bandits
might be harder than we had[A]
expected.
Ever since Bern started[A]
their invasion, something is
different with Elibe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wonder what's going to 
happen from now...[A]
Dragons reappearing, Bern's sudden
invasion, the collapse of[A]
the Lycia Alliance...[A]
All of these strange things
happening at once.[A]
Still, we have to take things one
at a time however tedious it[A]
may seem.[A]

[DA]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...
What do we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]How about moving north
along the coast?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]North...
Towards the mines?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right. I've heard that the people
living on the islands are being[A]
forced into labor over there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So we must
rescue them first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Then we might be able to
find out who's behind all this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must start
somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right...
Let's head north.[A]

[DB]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now... where do we go
from here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's head west.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]West?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've heard there's a rebel
group based there.[A]
They're fighting the bandits
to protect the villagers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. So we can visit them and
gather some information on what's[A]
going on these islands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right. If we just go searching
blindly, we won't get anywhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have no objections,
Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
then let's head west.[A]

[DC]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Now... where do we go from here?
We must choose.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do you have an idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If we follow the coast up
north, we should reach the[A]
largest mine on the isles.
Perhaps the bandits gather there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our task is to get rid of
all of the bandits.[A]
We shouldn't be wandering
around aimlessly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You're right.
Let's head north![A]
[DD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1E4][ToggleSmile]How is that spy from the
resistance force doing?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Do you mean that dancer called
Lalum, or something?[A]
We threw her in the
dungeon, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well,
did she admit anything?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, she just keeps repeating that
it is some kind of mistake and[A]
that she has nothing to do with
the resistance force.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, she thinks she can get
away with that, does she?[A]
I should go ask
her myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Nord![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is a messenger here
sent by the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Ah, it's the army that was sent to
clean up the bandits on these isles..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It seems that they want permission
to pass through to Mt. Ebrakhm.[A]
[OpenRight]...Lord Arcard did say to get rid
[ToggleSmile]of the Lycia Alliance Army while[A]
they were still here... Hehehe...
This is a great chance to show off[A]
to Lord Arcard and get a share
of his riches.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Send out some troops
and kill them off![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir..[A][Clear]
What about the messenger?[A]
[OpenRight]Kill him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understood sir.[A]
[OpenRight]Also, don't forget to bring
out the ballistae.[A]
Those are some nice weapons that
can attack from afar, so use[A]
them to confuse the Alliance army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes sir.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]And make sure the enemy
doesn't get ahold of them![A]
[DE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Are there some

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, they seem

[OpenMidRight]... What about the messenger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He hasn't returned yet...
That means...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?[A]
Why is Nord attacking us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The enemy is advancing...
Master Roy, what should we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I guess we'll have to fight.[A]
Anyway, we need to get to the castle.
Then we might learn something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
I suppose so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, we're going

But don't kill more than
you have to![A]

Where's Gonzales?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][FastPrint]Here... I here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]There's a village to the north,
right along the mountain.[A]
You understand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That might be a hidden base for
the resistance forces.[A]
I want you to go there and
destroy it, village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Right. Now go![A]
A stupid brute like you only
comes in use at times like this.[A]
Now get moving.[A]

I gotta avenge them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those guys that always
were with you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah... When I wasn't around, they
were taken to the mines, and told[A]
that they would be given work.[A]
But they worked like slaves
until they...died.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Maybe they weren't that smart,
but they were good guys...[A]
And somebody just killed them off...
just like that...!![A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're going to
avenge them on your own?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is there something wrong
with that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
But you're not going back[A]
to being a sea merchant?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
Once I avenge my friends[A]
and once the war resides,
I'll think about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... We won't forget you.

[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[A]

you're going up against the[A]
castle's soldiers on your own.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm Roy, leader of the Lycia
Alliance Army.[A]
We're here due to a
request from Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're with Etruria?!
Then you're not on my side.[A]
Die![A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, wait!
We're also fighting the[A]
castle's troops.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't know either.
We were sent here by Etruria to[A]
rid the islands of the bandits,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You said that you're fighting
the castle's troops.[A]
Then you wanna hire me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm a pirate, so I'm pretty familiar
with the lands around here.[A]
You look like you've never been
here before, so you could use a[A]
guide, couldn't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That would help,
but why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to help you with
your mission.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I'm a pirate, so I'm
probably part of the "bandits"[A]
that you're talking about, but
I generally only go after rich[A]
people who have more than they
need anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
then I'll ask you to help us.[A]
We don't know this area very well,
so we were having trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Great!
Leave it to me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... This is it, guys.
I'll avenge you with all of[A]
my strength![A]
After that, I guess I can tag
along with that Roy guy...[A]
[E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x184]
[ToggleSmile]I'm worried --
Is Lalum all right?[A]
For our sake she brought us weapons
from all over the place.[A]
Even when we begged her to hide,
she still continued to help us.[A][Clear]
Here's an axe that she brought us.
It's a pretty strange one...[A]
It's strong against swords,
but weak against spears![A]
But instead of this, I'd
rather see her dance again...[A]
[E7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
[ToggleSmile]The bandits and pirates...[A]
You know, when they're born,
they're so cute.[A]
Maybe if I spoke to them,
I'd have an understanding.[A]
[E8]
[LoadFace][0x1E4]So you made it here.[A][Clear]
I shall take your
lives...[A]
[E9]
[LoadFace][0x1E4][ToggleSmile]...Death?[A][Clear]
I feel... my life..
draining.. away...[A]
[EA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
We couldn't find out why Nord
attacked us in the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But now there's no mistake
that there's somebody after us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, I think we should contact
Etruria about this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. I'll talk to
General Cecilia about this.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152]Excuse me, Master Roy.[A]
There's a girl whom we found
captured in the dungeon.[A]
She wishes to speak with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To me?
Let her pass.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]You are Master Roy?
The one who's here to clear[A]
out the bandits?[SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][SendToBack][CloseSpeechFast]Roy, please!
Please rescue my friends![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Wow![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][MoveLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hey!
Get off of him![A]
[OpenFarRight]A-Anyway let's calm down
and talk.[A]
Your friends are in danger?[A][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]My name is Lalum.[A]
I'm part of the resistance forces
on this island.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]The one that fights the bandits
and protects the people living here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[.....]
...No![A]
[OpenFarRight]No?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course that's part of our job,
but our real enemy is Etruria![A]
They are working with the bandits
to take more money and resources[A]
from people![A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What!
Is that true!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The marquesses and warlords living here
are taking people into the mine [A]
and work them until they die!![A]
They never let them rest,
even if they're sick or injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Horrible...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]So we're fighting the Etrurian
government to protest against them![A]
Our next plan was to attack the mine
at Mt. Ebrakhm and rescue the[A]
people there![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What's the matter!
Calm down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A villager here leaked the
information on our plan![A]
He was probably tortured,
but I didn't think he would[A]
tell...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]I have to go to the mines
before everyone's captured![SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, then let's go![A]
We have to rescue the resistance forces
and people being forced into labor![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Really!?
Thank you, Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
M-Miss Lalum![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][MoveLeft]Hey!
I said get off of him![A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here, Roy.
Use this sword.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It belongs to our leader, Echidna.
Because you're helping us,[A]
I don't think she'll get mad[A]
even if you use it.[A]
It's called the "Dragon Killer", but
there aren't any Dragons anymore.[A]
Maybe they're useful against
Dragon Knights?[A]
Well I don't really know.[.....]
But it should come to be[A]
handy sometime.[A]
[EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]So Princess Guinevere is nowhere
on the Western Isles?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We searched all over these islands,[A]
and we sent spies in to the
Lycia Alliance Army, but we could[A]
not find the princess anywhere.
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.
I suppose I will search elsewhere.[A]
Bishop Oro, I thank you for your
cooperation with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I will pray that you will be able
to meet with Princess Guinevere soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][ClearFace]
[EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x140]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Bishop Oro,
who was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]A Dragon Knight from Bern.
Her name is Miledy.[A]
She was looking for Princess
Guinevere, who is her mistress.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you tell her where
the princess is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
Princess Guinevere is a valuable hostage.[A]
When Advisor Roartz heard news that
Cecilia was hiding with Guinevere in[A]
Aquleia, he was as excited as the
time when he was reported the[A]
assassination of Prince Mildain
had been successful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bishop Oro!
You mustn't say he[A]
was assassinated...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I must watch my tongue.
Anyway, Guinevere has much value.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And now,
why did you come before me?[A]
Did you not have something
to say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my lord.[A]
It is about the village where
the resistance leader is hiding.[A]
We are now prepared to launch an
attack on the village, so I came[A]
to report.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, well done.[A]
Then start your attack immediately,
before we have any unwanted[A]
interruptions..[A]
[ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So the resistance hideout is in
one of these villages here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
But it's possible that the landlord's
troops have attacked it already.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]I must say, that Oro is a
despicable man.[A]
A bishop should be preaching
the words of God to help the[A]
people.
But in fact he is torturing[A]
his people!
That is far from forgivable![A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]We should probably wait for
General Cecilia's reply, but...[A][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy![A]
Troops from the castle are
attacking the villages![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]What!
Master Roy, should we attack?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]I guess we can't wait for her
reply then... But I want to[A]
help the people here.[A]
Even if it means that we'll be on
bad terms with Etruria...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126]Roy..[A]
[OpenRight]Let's fight!![A]
So we can be proud of our actions
when we return to Lycia![A]
[EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x136]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Miledy, did you find out
where Princess Guinevere is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
It looks like she left the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Just when I thought I had
found her...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So it's no use looking,
then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Gale...
I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the
case on Princess Guinevere in[A]
secrecy, so he only assigned
my group to look for her.[A]
I'm sorry I got you mixed
up into this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're one of the captains working
directly under General Murdock.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Murdock has agreed to
my helping you out.[A]
Anyway, Princess Guinevere must
still be on the mainland.[A]
Well then, I guess we'll ask
General Narshen for some more[A]
help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You're going to bow to
General Narshen?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Hm?
Of course.[A]
He's one of the Three Dragon Lords,
and he's in charge of the armies[A]
attacking Lycia and Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Gale,
aren't you... mad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I mean...[A]
Skill wise, you should be one of
the Three Dragon Lords.[A]
But Narshen accused you of not being
a native of Bern, and he snatched[A]
the position away from you.[A]
And you're going to bow down to
him and ask him for help?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well, what he said was true...
I wasn't born in Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm happy with the position I
have now.[A]
And King Zephiel and General
Murdock put trust in me, even[A]
if I'm not a native of Bern.
What more could I ask?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Gale...[A]
[EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]Echidna!
We have surrounded this entire area![A]
We know you are hiding in there![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x133][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleMouthMove]You are Echidna,

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x189][CloseSpeechFast]Miss Echidna, I'm sorry!
They took my family hostage...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.
Leave this to me.[A]
Hurry home to your family now.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Sorry...
Really.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][CloseSpeechFast]If you surrender peacefully,
perhaps Bishop Oro will have[A]
mercy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sorry, but I'm sorta
the stubborn type.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll resist?
Then we have no choice![A][Clear]
Kill her![A]
[F1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x140]Hahaha...
I've got an idea... Somebody![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lord?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell the bandits that the
villages are in a confused state.[A]
I want them to ransack the villages
and collect all the money and[A]
treasure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes.
But.. are you sure?[A]
If this becomes public...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You forget I speak for God himself.[A]
If anyone tries to accuse me
it would be going against God![A]
Therefore, no one on this island
can prosecute me![A]
Anyway, hurry. It won't be any use
if the crisis in the villages[A]
slow down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[F2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151]So you're sure we can raid the
villages as much as we want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]Yes.
But in return...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah yeah, we're supposed to take
half the loot to the castle, right?[A]
That's one hell of a Bishop you
guys got there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thank you for your
cooperation.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]All right, boys!
Loot the villages![A]
Grab all the treasure![A]
[F3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, bandits are approaching
from the mountains to the east.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They're thinking of attacking the
villages during the confusion...[A]
We have to stop them and rescue
the people![A]
[F4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is taking so long?![A]
Are the resistance forces
that much of a problem?![A]
[OpenMidRight]The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
They are supporting the
resistance force...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What![A]
The Lycia Alliance would turn
against Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have just received a message
from the capital of Djuto![A]
It says...[A]
"The Lycia Alliance Army is responsible
for the murder of Marquess Nord.[A]
They are suspected for turning
against Etruria.[A]
There is also the possibility they
are tied in with the bandits.[A]
Capture them, or kill them if
necessary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So they killed Marquess Nord...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Anyway, they've come up with a
good excuse to get rid of the[A]
Lycia Alliance Army.
Hahaha... tied in with the[A]
bandits, eh?
How ironic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcard has provided some
reinforcements to help us capture[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.
They should be here shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How generous!
He said 'capture them', but he
probably plans on killing them[A]
anyway.[A]
So let's do the job for him.
Kill them all![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lord![A]
[F5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]Bishop Oro,
additional reinforcements will[A]
be arriving shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
I hope this will be enough.[A]
They are fighting better

Good.. If something happened to
you, I wouldn't know what to[A]
say to Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry... If I hadn't been
caught, I could have told you earlier..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's okay.
Don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't cry over spilled milk.
That's not like you.[A]
And besides,
I'm all in one piece.[A]
That's good news, no?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... Yeah.[A]
So anyway, who's the army
attacking the castle right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army!
They came here to defeat the[A]
bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia, eh?
They've sure come a far
way to get here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And does it look like
they'll help us out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes!
They helped me too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]All right,
then I guess I'll join too![A]
That's okay, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?

Pleased to meet you,[A]

I am a member of the

[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My thanks for saving
our village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, we simply did what
we thought was right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.[A]
Certainly you had thought of
that before you took action?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so,
we did what we felt was right.[A]
Although what we did was a sign
of rebellion against Etruria,[A]
if the truth about these islands
is made public, they will understand.[A]
I have sent a letter to a trustworthy
member of the Etrurian nobility.[A]
If she takes the appropriate
measures, I'm sure we can tip[A]
the tables in our favor.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not be so
sure of that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Did you ever think it strange
Etruria sent you in to get[A]
rid of bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...
Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There is merely my theory..
But I believe the ones who [A]
requested your help, are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... How do you know that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Why did those two have to get
your army off of the mainland?[A]
Could there be some kind of problem
if you stayed in Lycia?[A]

They are approaching here to
take my head![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, them.[A]
They are somewhat of a nuisance
to us of Bern...[A]
We figured it would get difficult
if they became friendly with Etruria,[A]
so we had you send them here...[A]
Well... they fight better
than I would have expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you saying!
Do you know how much I have[A]
lost because of them?
All the riches that I've earned[A]
from these islands... N-No!
Before that, my life![A]
My life is in danger![A]
If they reach here,
I am done for![A]
What must I do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you are that worried,
you should leave this capital[A]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Warfare is what Bern is best at.
And besides, we have our secret[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]A human?
Turning into a dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can say nothing at this point.
We must proceed with caution.[A]
[0107]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...
[ToggleSmile]Once we take it down,[A]
we can go home.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12B][ToggleSmile]I have sent someone in
already to unlock the gate...[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x126]
[OpenFarRight]Oh,

[OpenRight]The one over there
dressed like a dancer?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Yes.[A][SendToBack]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty?[A]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty!
You're late.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Lalum,
who is 'Your Majesty'?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]?...Oh!
Ah...er...[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]You know,
you look so much[A]

[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]My apologies,
Master Roy.[A]
This is Lalum,
a member of the resistance.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're Roy?[A]
Everyone on these islands has
heard of you![A]
They call you the
'Savior from the East'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Nice to meet you,
I'm Lalum.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Please leave a little distance![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, your face is all red.
How cute~~~!!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]...Lalum...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Oh! R-Right...
I've been hearing strange rumors.[A]
The people here say that a 'human
not human' resides in this castle.[A]
[OpenRight]A human not human...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
They say he changes form into a
creature nobody has ever seen before.[A]
say it looked like one of the
legendary Dragons![A]
[OpenRight]A human?
Turning into a Dragon!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know...
but maybe.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]We must
proceed with caution.[A][SendToBack]
[0108]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x141][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F]Ah, there you are,
Aine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I heard you called...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will go report about the Lycia
Alliance Army to General Narshen.[A]
I want you to defend this castle
while I am away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]... Understood.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Hm?
Who's there![A][Clear][......]
[ToggleMouthMove]...... Just the wind...[A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well then, I shall be going.
I leave the rest to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Haha... The Lycia Alliance
won't stand a chance against[A]
this Dragon.[A]
They won't even be able to
scratch it with normal weapons.[A]
These mamkutes...
They certainly are terrible beasts.[A]
[0109]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125]...So that's what the
'human not human' is.[A]
So it is true that Bern has
brought back the Dragons[A]
into this world.[A]
... So what can I do now...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I'll act like one
of the soldiers and[A]
observe the Dragons power.[A]
[010A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]All the way down here
in the isles in the west,[A]
people working to death for
the nobles in their nest![A]
Well, if that's true, this castle
must be loaded with treasure![A]
The loot wasn't earned rightfully
by the nobles anyway, so I guess[A]
I'll grab it all for myself![A]
[010B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x141][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]The reinforcements from the
south will arrive shortly![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......T-that's all,
Sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]That guy
scares me...[A]
[010C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]
Did you take care of
the cave on the outskirts?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1DB]
Yes, sir.[A]
We hired the bandits
to block the entrance.[A]
No one will be able to
get the Divine Weapon now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Great![A]
Now all we have to do is get
rid of the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[010D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Ray? Ray!
It's good to see you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad that you
look okay.[A]
We were worried.
You just left one day,[A]
saying that you were 'going on a
journey to train your magic skills'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be able to
effectively learn magic sitting[A]
in that orphanage.[A]
It was a miracle that I
could learn what I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ray...
The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]?
What happened?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bern's forces came...
and burned it down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... What happened to everybody?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father was killed
protecting us...[A]
The little children are under the
protection of the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I see.[A]
Good...they'll be happier
living with the church[A]
instead of an old orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to say
it that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Ray!
Come with us.[A]
Let's defeat Bern and
pick up the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't find
interest in such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Still... the Lycia Alliance Army
might not be a bad place to be.[A]
They seem to have some kind of
connection with the Dragons.[A]
So if you insist,
I suppose I can go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ray...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I hope you understand![A]
I'm not joining to avenge Father
or the orphanage or anything![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes!

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So don't look

[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly.
What are you doing here?[A]
What happened to the
orphanage?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]... So you are concerned, even
though you just ran off like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I was never concerned.
You just reminded me of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]... The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Bern's troops burned it to the
ground when they invaded Lycia.[A]
Father...
He was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What!?
They killed Father...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Father.
I know we're stuck on these islands[A]

[OpenMidRight]Well, I suppose there's no

[OpenMidLeft]... I'll go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?!

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern seems to be tied in

I'm curious about them.[A]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That was close...[A]
The power of a Dragon... amazing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]A human not human...
This is what it meant.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How many more of these
does Bern have...?[A]
[......]How are we supposed to put up a
fight against monsters like this!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
Please calm yourself.[A]
[OpenRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand your worries.[A]
But if you start to panic, everyone
in this army will start to get[A]
anxious.
Please understand that.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is a perfectly understandable
reaction after fighting something[A]
like that.[A]
But now... we know something
that we did not before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not remember?[A]
I told you of the rumor
that Arcard was tied in[A]
with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
If there are Bern's Dragons in
the Etrurian capital...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So Arcard was indeed
taking contract with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That means Lycia is in danger...[A]
We must return to the mainland.
We have to contact General Cecilia[A]
and think of a plan...[A]

[0114]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, before returning[A]
to the mainland, we still
have things to do on these isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are there still more enemies?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
One of the Divine Weapons[A]
is hidden in a cave near here.[A]
If we can obtain it,
fighting the Dragons will[A]
become a little easier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Divine Weapon... Exactly!
If we can get all eight of them,[A]
we have a chance of defeating Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... we must obtain[A]
as many as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go
to the cave you speak of![A]
[0115]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Report![A]
I have a message from Etruria...[A]
A rebellion has broken out at the
Etrurian Castle City of Aquleia.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]What![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The rebel leaders are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
They have captured King Mordred,
and they are announcing their plan[A]
to divide ownership of the world
between Bern and Etruria![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]No... the two strongest nations
in Elibe joining forces...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Is General Cecilia all right!?
And how about Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We do not have accurate
information...[A]
But it seems like the Three
Etrurian Generals have split up.[A]
Sorcery General Cecilia has escaped
from Aquleia and is headed[A]
for the Island of Misul
in the west.[A]
[OpenRight]What about the other Generals?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]They have been forced to join
the rebels because King Mordred[A]
was taken hostage.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Master Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We need to contact
General Cecilia...[A]
Princess Guinevere...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Y-Your Majesty!?

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just now.[A]
The general from Etruria fights well,
I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes... But we shall have everything
under control very soon.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, let me.
I will fight her myself.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][FastPrint]Your Highness, there is

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No matter.
It shall be some good exercise.[A][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142]

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I suppose this is all one could
expect from an Etrurian General.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty.[A]
If you would allow it,
can you leave her to me?[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have some certain... bad memories

I want to punish her for them.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, all right.

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Your Majesty.[......]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]Bern is attacking the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...This isn't what they said.[A]
They had decided to leave the Etrurian
matters to us Etrurians.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What shall we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was it General Narshen who made
the order to attack the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, sir.
It was King Zephiel himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
The king did it himself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]So it looks like Bern had
no intention of leaving anything to[A]
us in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]We are going to move right now.
Tell the rest of them that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight]Well, if there's still a possibility
that she's alive, then I won't[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Zephiel, why?[A]
Why do you cause a war, killing[A]
innocent people...[A]
[OpenRight]Innocent, you say?
Hmph, jealousy, vanity, greed...[A]
People are fighting over these silly
things in every nation.[A]
And you say they are innocent?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Well...[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]The world must be liberated
from such pointless things that[A]
men fight over.
That is the purpose of this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But... people are being
brutally killed in the process.[A]
[OpenRight]Sacrifice is always needed
in a radical change.[A]
That is nothing new.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Zephiel...![A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Guinevere, you are my only sister.[A]
Therefore,
I will forgive you this time.[A]
But not the next.
Do you understand?[A]

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narshen![A]
The leader of Guinevere's defenders
is here, no?[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x142]Yes.
Her name is Miledy.[A]
[OpenRight]All right.[A]
Tell her to take Guinevere
back to Bern.[A]
Also tell her to make sure that
the Fire Emblem is returned to[A]

[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Miledy, please!

[CloseSpeechFast]...Should I oblige,
what would you do next?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I understand that Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army is near here...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]!?[.....]
You would join the Enemy!?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]If we do nothing, the world will
be overrun by Bern's forces...[A]
No matter what kind of reasoning he
gives, what he is doing is the same.[A]
He is forcing others into submission
through power.[A]
And I do not think that will lead
to anything good...[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Miledy,
I ask you to let me go.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]...There is one thing.[A]
[OpenFarRight]?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is one thing I cannot
forgive you for, Your Highness.[A]
When you left Bern earlier, why did
you not come and ask for my opinion...?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Well... I thought your
reputation would be damaged.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Did you think I would
prioritize my reputation above you?[A]
I am your loyal Knight more
than I am a Knight of Bern.[A]
That has not changed since
I was knighted.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Miledy...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So if you told me to let you go, then I

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narshen.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142]
[OpenRight]I will give you some Dragons to

I want you to send some

[OpenMidLeft]The Nabata Desert?[A]
The desert lands located in the

[OpenRight]Right.[A]
I heard that there is a hidden
village there where Dragons have been[A]
staying since the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... then there is a high chance
that a Divine Weapon is located there.[A]
[OpenRight]Exactly.[A]
They must not fall into the hands
of the enemy.[A]
I already sent some
troops to start attacking,[A]
but they are outnumbered.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Your Majesty.[A]
I shall have the village
taken in no time.[A]

Maybe I didn't do a good job...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes, you did.
Thank you.[A]
We must find a way out

...Ow...![A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Don't move...
The wound will open again.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]But I must do something...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It will be all right.[A]
I can see a light... that

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.
That light will aid us both...[A]
We must wait for it...[A]

It's them![A]
The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?

I thought you had taken care
of them at Djuto![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did![A]
Well... I left a Dragon to
deal with them, so...[A]
I never thought they would
have survived![A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
In that case, my reputation as your
Commanding Officer is also jeopardized![A]
If I can't defeat the
Lycia Alliance Army here, people[A]

I must do something...
But they defeated a Dragon...[A]
They seem to be tougher
Than I expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Narshen...
What should we do...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have no choice...
Flaer.[A]
I will return to Aquleia and
plan an attack on the[A]
Lycia Alliance Army.
Flaer, you stay here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][FastPrint]!
M-Me... Stay here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to defeat them.[A]
I just want you to hit them as

their numbers.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]General Narshen!
You would use me as cannon fodder![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Flaer...[A]
To tell you the truth, you would
have been executed a long time[A]

You should be thankful.
Hehehe...[A]

[ToggleSmile]Yes, what is it,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We're leaving.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's actions are clearly an act of
insult to us of Etruria.[A]
I cannot aid Bern any further
We must return to Aquleia and[A]
inform Lord Douglas of this

Retreat at once![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]

I got it to defend myself because
I heard an army was approaching,[A]

We tried to stay an

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They attacked you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
I... was too slow,
and I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see... but why would Bern
attack a small village like yours?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I don't know...[A]
Maybe they found out about the
Dragons that live in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Dragons!?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes...
Arcadia was built by Dragons and people[A]
joining forces a long time ago...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]...Such a place existed...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy...
Please, save our village...[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]But the story does seem

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]In any case, it's probably true that

Please take it.[A]

Fa's tired![A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't be stubborn.[A]
Now go, or else Bern's
soldiers might find us.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]What about Sophia?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't know...[A]
Maybe she was caught by
Bern's troops.[A]
[OpenFarRight]If we get caught by Bern, then
can we see the outside world?[A]
[OpenLeft]Fa, no.[A]
The elder said that we mustn't
communicate with the outside world.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][NormalPrint]Aw...
Please?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[A]
... But I wonder how Bern
found out about our village...[A]
Perhaps it has something to do
with the ominous 'force' that[A]
Sophia said she detected
from the soldiers...[A]
[OpenFarRight]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenLeft]![A]
I shouldn't be thinking about
such matters now![A]

[OpenMidLeft]A band of mercenaries and some
Dragons have arrived as[A]
reinforcements, but General
Narshen's group hasn't arrived yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is he doing?[A]
He must know it is impossible to
take over the village with[A]
such a small army like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Anyway, we must inform the King

Zeiss, I want you to go to Aquleia
and report to King Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What do you want
me to say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Dragons do indeed inhabit
this village.[A]
According to a captive, there are
also signs of 'Divine Dragons,'[A]
the most powerful even among Dragons.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Make it quick.[A]

I can't see three meters ahead...
So in which direction do we move?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes...
Head to the Northeast...[A]
But...[A]

[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]But, my dear Maggie, we don't want
to get lost in the sandstorm, do we?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Of course not, Rose.[A]
Then we wouldn't be able to

[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Well then, Maggie, do you think we
should pass up the hidden village?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, you forget
there are rumors of vast[A]
treasures hidden in this village.[A][OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
Well, we certainly don't want to
miss that, do we, Maggie?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course, Rose.[A]
We can make a lot more money

[OpenRight][MoveFarRight]But we don't want to get
lost either, do we, Maggie?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose,

We may follow the people
we saw heading into[A]
the desert earlier.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That's a wonderful idea, Maggie.[A]
And once we reach the village,
we can thank them by smashing[A]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course, my dear Rose.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Well then, Maggie,
shall we be off?[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Elder, do you know anything

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What!
There are Dragons in Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we have seen them.[A]
[OpenLeft]Why...?[A]
Dragons do not exist anywhere
except here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11B]Elder,
if I may.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]What is it, Igrene?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia said that she could detect an
evil 'force' coming from Bern's troops.[A]
That may have something to do with the
Dragons Roy says he saw at Bern.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Perhaps...[A]
But I am too old to detect
such force now.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]'Force?'
What is that?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia is half dragon, half human.[A]
That gives her the ability to detect
the pulses emitted from other Dragons.[A]
But because she cannot detect them
clearly, she only said that she felt a[A]
Force that was twisted unnaturally.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I think that you should
look into it.[A]
Elder, if you would allow it,
I would like to ask to join[A]
Roy and look into Bern for myself.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]I really do not want to deal
with the matters of the outside...[A]
But this is a time of emergency.
Well then Roy, will you take her?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I am Igrene,
the Guardian of Nabata.[A]
I have confidence in my skills

[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]General Raeth, about the

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Girl?[A]
The one that was scurrying around
the outskirts of the castle?[A]
Are you still worrying about
that thing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Just throw her out.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]But sir,
she was carrying this.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]?
Is this... a Dragon Stone?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... That is what I thought also,
so I decided to report.[A]
[OpenRight]Have you ever seen
a Dragon Stone before?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes,
when we invaded Lycia.[A]
The Mamkutes were carrying them
when they were in human form.[A]
[OpenRight]... But it looks different from
the ones that they held.[A]
Well anyway, it still has to
do with the Dragons.[A]
I suppose we should inform
King Zephiel about it and[A]
follow his instructions.[A]
Make sure that the girl[A]
stays inside the castle![A]
[0145]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Fa has been taken to
that castle over there?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]Yes.
The locals have witnessed it.[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B]Roy, I am truly sorry...
One of my people has caused you[A]
great inconvenience, when we must
be hurrying toward Aquleia.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]No, please don't worry about it.
If she falls into the hands of Bern,[A]
that in itself would be a disaster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe she would be safe as long
as she remains in human form and[A]
doesn't show anyone her Dragon Stone.[A]
[OpenRight]Dragon Stone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, when Dragons are in their human[A]
form, they seal their powers into
crystals called Dragon Stones.[A]
In this world, it is said that
Dragons must use vast amounts of[A]
energy to maintain their actual
form, so they usually remain in[A]
human form to minimize energy consumption.[A]
[OpenRight]Maybe the 'humans not human' in Bern
were in human form for the same reason.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]By listening to the story you told
us earlier, probably you are right.[A]
It is also said that Dragons started
taking human form ever since the end[A]
of the Scouring.[A]
[OpenRight]That long ago...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy,[A]
the spy we sent to the
castle has returned.[A]
[OpenRight]What did you find out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems that a lot of soldiers
have been coming out of the castle.[A]
They seem to be fortifying the
defenses around it.[A]
[OpenRight]Oh...
Maybe they found out Fa was a dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And the troops protecting the border
seem to have noticed us.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to rescue her quickly.[A]
[0146]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Percival,
you must not force yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Douglas, please do not worry about me.
You must return to King Mordred's side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Getting rid of the
Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
That is a job that requires the
Knight General's assistance.[A]
But still you were sent...
Roartz, that snake.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He must be wary of my
turning against him.[A]
He must be thinking that if I
were stationed at Aquleia, I would[A]
murder him in his sleep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That man, worrying about traitors?
Ha![A]
Why, he was the first to
betray his loyalty to the king![A]
The dastard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, Lord Douglas, it just goes to show
that not many have such loyalty as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Rubbish.
Look at yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... When Prince Mildain was still
alive, I had no hesitations.[A]
I believed that I would dedicate
my life to him and the wellbeing[A]
of Etruria.[A]
And this mission...
It is to protect the king's life.[A]
That should be enough reason to
fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you hesitate now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, slightly.[A]
But it matters not.
Nothing will change if I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Percival, my speech from this point is
merely to myself. Do not reply to it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria...[A]
will most certainly fall with
the king before this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
Lord Douglas!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen![A]
No matter what happens,
I will stay by the king's side.[A]
But you, Percival, you are
different.[A]
You are the one who will lead
tomorrow's Etruria.[A]
I cannot say when, but I
firmly believe that Etruria[A]
will be blessed with prosperity
once more.[A]
So, Percival, you must leave
Etruria and wait until that[A]
time comes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Lord Douglas!
What does...[A]
 [OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]General Percival![A]
We have confirmed the
Lycia Alliance Army up ahead![A]
What are your orders, sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now go!
I will return to Aquleia now.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]... Move forth!
Pursue the Lycia Alliance Army![A]
[0147]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is gonna be a battlefield too...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So what do we do, Boss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The army's gonna loot the villages anyway.
'Suppose we better ransack em' first.[A][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Awright, Boss![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But make sure you don't do any
unnecessary killing, you got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Got it...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]That guy's too nice...[A]
Well, I guess we can
make it the army's fault.[A]
[0148]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft]General Raeth,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Send them out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[0149]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B]
[OpenMidRight]Percival.
It is good to see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![.....]
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you forgotten my face?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...it cannot be.
The prince...is dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I understand your confusion.[A]
After all, a man who was pronounced
dead is standing before your very[A]
eyes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain![A]
You were alive...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have troubled you for a long
time now.[A]
...It has been over a year since I
was assassinated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Assassinated!?[A]
Your Highness, did you not fall
off your horse in accident?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.
I was shot with a poisoned arrow.[A]
First to my horse...and then to
me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Douglas noticed first and made it
public that I had been killed.[A]
A different corpse was placed in
coffin, and everything was set up[A]
as if the assassination had been
successful.[A]
Douglas then entrusted me to his
adopted daughter and let me escape[A]
to the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Douglas did that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even after I escaped to the west,
I suffered from a high fever[A]
caused by the poison for many
months.[A]
I was hovering so long between
life and death that Douglas'[A]
daughter gave up hope countless[A]
times.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]The resistance forces helped me by
giving me medicine.[A]
Ironic, is it not?[A]
They, who were fighting against
Etrurian nobility, had saved the[A]
life of the Etrurian Prince![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I recovered... slowly.[A]
And then I saw the horrors being
committed by the Etrurian nobles[A]
in the area.[A]
I felt ashamed that I had not
noticed when I was still residing[A]
on the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidRight]While aiding the resistance forces, I
was looking for a chance to return to[A]
the mainland.[A]
Then Roy came along, and I saw my
chance.[A]
And that is how I ended up here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince...[A]
I am truly thankful that
you have returned alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am with the Lycia Alliance Army
right now, but I must still hide my[A]
identity.[A]
And if I still have the loyalty
you pledged to me in the past...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am at your service,
my Prince.[A]
My master is only one, and he
is you, Prince Mildain.[A]
[014A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Percival![A]
It is you, isn't it?
I was looking for you![A]
I am...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[ToggleSmile]Wait! Wait!
Stop your horse![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you know!?
I thought we met before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I sort of recall seeing you
at Douglas's manor.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
That's me.[A]
You do know me, then![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But the girl I saw there was
a little more...ordinary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?
Ah, no matter.[A]
Anyway, my name[ToggleSmile] is Lalum.[A]
I'm here under the command
of Prince Mildain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain...?
Don't be daft.[A]
The prince was killed in
an accident the year before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
Look at this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![A]
That emblem...
belongs to the prince...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now do I have your attention?[A]
Then look at this letter too,
the prince told me to give it[A]
to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
It is the prince's handwriting...[ToggleMouthMove]
So he was alive![A]
Then I hesitate no more.[A]
If the Prince is in the Lycia
Alliance Army, then I must do[A]
the same.[A]
[ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wha-?
That was quick...[A]
I was hoping things to get more
dramatic...[A]
Like,[A]
'If you would still fight us, then
you would have to cut me down first!'[A]
Or something like that...[A]
[014B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Why?
Why do you attack the villages?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
Who do you think you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tell me your reason
for attacking the villages![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reason? ...[A]
Well, I guess I could say
that it's your fault.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our fault?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yup.[A]
Because you idiots are causing wars
like this, there are more and more[A]
people like me who have to do
banditry to get food.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We are fighting to help
people like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right, I've heard that enough
times now.[A]
Look at reality, kid.[A]
They all say they're trying
to help, but it's all words[A]
and empty promises.[A]
Where's the action?[A]
You got your head in the clouds, you
can't see what goes on the ground.[A]
Get it?
Now get out of my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What!?[A]
Listen, I ain't playing
games with you.[A]
If you don't get the[A]
hell out of here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I won't move.[A]
If you want to kill me,
then you may do as you wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If I let you pass, I would just
be another one of those people who[A]
you say are all talk and no action.
I am telling the truth![A]
We are fighting to help the people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]You... Hehe...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I never thought I'd meet anyone
so naive to think as you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you...
laugh at us...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]But still, it's nice to hear[A]
once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]!
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]All right, you win.
I'll stop looting.[A]
But you gotta let me
fight with you guys.[A]
I gotta see with my own
eyes that you're[A]
true to your words.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
If you fight alongside us,
I'm sure you will understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, you certainly seem
confident about that.[A]
I'm Garret.
And you're...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina?[A]
Well then, I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance, milady.[A]
[014C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]General Percival![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Roy.[A]
I wish to join your cause.
Would it be all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
Someone of your ability
would always be welcome.[A]
But why have you suddenly
[ToggleSmile]changed your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Must I answer
that question?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I wouldn't force you
if you have a reason not to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive me.[A]
I shall tell you
when the time comes.[A]
[014D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]
[ToggleSmile]The little girl that was running
around here...[A]
She got taken away to
the castle.[A]
Here, I'll give you this,
so you can rescue her?[A]
It was a book that our priest
was always carrying.[A]
... He got taken away to the castle, too.
But he never returned.[A]
[014E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]
This is the Hammerne staff.
It can repair your weapons, spell books,[A]
and staves. But there's one thing
it can't repair,[A]
and that's itself.[A]
[Clear]
It can repair anything...[A]
But the staff itself
just rots away.[A]
[014F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
I've been hearing about
bandits in these areas.[A]
Sigh... They must be brutal
and savage killers.[A]
[0150]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
The rumors say that the Three
Etrurian Generals have become divided..[A]
but so have the people's
hearts. I can only hope they[A]
don't start fighting each other...[A]
[0151]
[LoadFace][0x143][ToggleSmile]Gah...!
Hmm...[A]
There must be a reason you
attack this castle...[A]
But what...?[A]
[0152]
[LoadFace][0x143]
[ToggleSmile]Gah...!
That girl...
She isn't human, is she![A]
Why... do you seek her...!
To use her power...? ...![A]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
Here she is![A]
[OpenMidRight]You found her?
Wait, I'm coming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Now young lady,

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][FastPrint]... Sniff...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's ok, Merlinus.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]... Now, why did you follow us?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Fa just wanted to
see the outside world...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]What!
For such a reason...[A]
Do you know how much
confusion you have caused?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]But... but...
[MoveLeft]Fa's never, ever allowed outside![A]
The elders say that Fa has to

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Master Roy,
what shall we do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]... You've suffered a lot.[A]
But do you understand that you've
worried the elders and caused[A]
a lot of inconvenience?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Fa's sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Really sorry?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well then,
you can come with us.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]Really!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy might already know
about her.[A]
In that case, it's better
to have her where we can see[A]
her rather than letting her go
off back on her own to Arcadia.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yay![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Hush!
Don't get too excited.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you mustn't go off

Lord Murdock, is here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
H-Hurry![A]
Send someone out to escort him here!
Make sure he gets utmost attention...[A]
[OpenRight]He is already here..[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x147]Enough.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L-Lord Murdock...
What a pleasant surprise![A]
What brings you all the

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]Narshen, I believe you
owe me an explanation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry sir...[A]
I don't quite understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere has escaped, again.[A]
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed
in his mission at the Western Isles.[A]
Also, you have neglected the mission
of capturing the hidden village in[A]
Nabata as given from the king himself![A]
Narshen![A]
I want explanations.
Now![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Y-Yes...[A]
Well you see, my Lord, there have
been many complications, and..[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Enough.
I have orders from the king.[A]
You are to be demoted from Dragon
Lord status.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]His Majesty wants Gale
to take your place.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]My Lord!
Please wait![A]
Please give me one more chance!![A]
[OpenMidRight]... The Lycia Alliance Army is
approaching here.[A]
Show me your worth, and stop
them.[A]
If you succeed, I will negotiate
with the king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Murdock...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Narshen...[A]
Don't fail the king..
or me, again.[A]
[0157]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]Rubbish!
Me, demoted?![A]
And my replacement is that Gale...![A]
Never![A]
I will not allow that to happen![A]
B-But what can I do...
No...![A]
My honor, my status...
It's all collapsing![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint]General Narshen,
the enemy is getting close...[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Quiet!
I know that.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... Wait.[A]
Miledy's younger brother is
stationed in this castle...[A]
and she's the one who let
the princess escape![A]
Ah![A]
I can say we failed because he
was leaking information to the[A]
enemy and get rid of him later![A]
Hehehehe...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]General Narshen...
What were you thinking?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
Oh, you know Miledy's
younger brother, don't you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you mean Sir Zeiss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Right, Zeiss.[A]
Anyway, he's suspected of
[ToggleSmile]leaking information to[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Capture him and bring
him here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]What?[A]
But Sir Zeiss would never
do something like that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]Shut up![A]
All you must do is
follow my orders![A]
Now bring him here![A]
[0158]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,[A]
this is the palace of Aquleia.[A]
According to the information we
have gathered, the Coup d'etat[A]
forces are stationed inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel,
I thank you for your help.[A]
Thanks to the Elimine Church, we were
able to avoid fighting in the city[A]
and killing innocent people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No,
I must thank you.[A]
Our order was being prejudiced
by the Coup d'etat group, so if[A]
you hadn't come along to fight,
we would have been driven out of[A]
the land a long time ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prejudiced?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Most likely because we were
investigating Bern's Dragons.[A]
Saint Elimine, our founder, said[A]
this before she ascended to heaven,
"Never allow the Dragons to[A]
be brought back to the world...
It would mean death for many[A]
people."[A]
Therefore, we are making our best
efforts to find a way to[A]
send the Dragons back to the
world in which they belong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If the Coup d'etat forces had
joined with Bern, then of course[A]
they would want to stop you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]We also found
out this.[A]
The resurrection of the Dragons
is somehow tied to the Fire Emblem,[A]
Bern's greatest treasure.[A]
That's where I sent Saul
and Dorothy to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, you must stop the
Coup d'etat troops.[A]
And if you would allow me to
give you further advice,[A][SendToBack]
I would suggest that you do
not do any unnecessary killing.[A]
I am sure there are troops that
had no choice but to join the[A]
coup d'etat due to inner reasons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]May Saint Elimine bless you,
Master Roy.[A]
[0159]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x146][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]T-The enemy is right
at our doorstep![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x13D]Oh... what must we do![A]
If we get caught, we shall
be prosecuted as the initiators[A]

gotten rid of the Lycia Alliance[A]

[OpenRight][MoveRight]B-But Lord Roartz...!

This is not the time
to be arguing, my Lord![A]
We must escape![A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]But escape to where...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]... Let us turn to Bern![A]
This is originally
their plan...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Y-Yes, of course![A]
We have done what they
asked of us.[A]
They would be sure to

[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10A][FastPrint]... May I ask what you intend
to do with the king?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Er... No, they would
not harm the king.[A]
After all, King Zephiel's
mother was from Etruria.[A]
Anyway, Douglas, you must
escape too...[A]
[OpenFarRight]I refuse.[A]
I was originally fighting alongside
you because King Mordred's safety[A]
was at stake.[A]
I had no intention of going along
with your plans.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Hmph!
Stubborn as always, I see.[A]
Suit yourself.

I suppose I can leave those two

If Prince Mildain returns...[A]
Etruria will pull itself together
again.[A]
And until then... I shall fight

Just now, General Narshen gave an

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
Does he think that
I am betraying Bern?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He is trying to put the

on your shoulders.[A]
He is saying that you worked
with Miledy to leak information[A]
to the enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]With my sister?
We don't even know where she is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Miledy has apparently joined
the Lycia Alliance Army alongside[A]
the Princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]!![A]
Miledy turned to the enemy?!
I don't believe it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then get the story from
her yourself.[A]
I want to go with you as well,
but I have been told by[A]
Lord Murdock to watch the battle

Zeiss, I want you to escape when
you see the chance and go speak[A]
with your sister.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Gale said that you had joined
the enemy.[A]
But I couldn't believe it until now,
when I can see it with my own eyes![A]
Why!
Why did you betray Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never betrayed Bern.
I just wanted to help Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you threw away everything...
Your homeland, your family...[A]
Even your lover...

For that... stubborn princess who
betrayed her own brother![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]It is the princess, not the king,
who is truly working for the good[A]
of Bern.[A]
Granted, I was angry when the
princess left without consulting[A]
me at all.[A]
But now that I am at her side,
I understand more than ever..[A]
That she had not made a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... Sir Gale was right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What? Gale?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He said that he didn't intend

I had saved you from a hard[A]

[OpenMidRight]... You saved me from that terrible

[OpenMidLeft]... Is it that we must attack Bern
as well after Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
Did someone inform you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[A]
...But I knew that it would
happen eventually.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... We cannot leave Bern running
around freely any longer.[A]
I am sure that it would be hard
to see your nation invaded, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]... Roy,
I will give this to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]What is this?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]It is Bern's greatest treasure...
the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]What!?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]In the south of Bern lies
a temple called the Cave of Seals.[A]
In it lies the sword that our founder,
Hartmut, used.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is it...
one of the Divine Weapons?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It is said to be so.[A]
However, the sword was so immensely
powerful because it was made to slay[A]
the 'Dark Dragon', the leader of the
Dragons during the Dragon Human wars.[A]
Therefore, after the war, the sword
was sealed in the cave.[A]
The Fire Emblem is the key to open
the door to it.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The key...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My brother...is trying to force
the world into submission with[A]
military strength.[A]
That is something that is not
forgivable, no matter what the[A]
reason.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]To stop him, all we can
do is defeat the Dragons[A]
that are by his side.[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]... My name shall be stained in

betrayed her nation.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]No...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I shall be hated all my life

When we invade Bern, please
do not harm the civilians...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
Lord Murdock, did we really
not have to aid him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those were the king's orders.[A]
Besides, the Bern army has no

up his own mess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x13D]Lord Murdock...
What will become of us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Arcard, I will entrust this land

Lord Roartz, I will have you take
the land of Edessa.[A]
Please make preparations to retaliate.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What!?
Raemy is right on the border![A]
The enemy will arrive in no time![A]
[OpenMidRight]True.[A]
But this position also allows us
to easily launch an attack on Etruria.[A]
Make sure this castle does not fall.[A]
[OpenLeft]Edessa...[A]
It is in the outer wastelands
of Ilia...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would have plenty of time to
prepare your defenses, would you not?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]... You...
could not take back Etruria for us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is possible.[A]
But when we win, Etruria will
go under Bern's rule.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]No!
That will not do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I suggest that you find a way
to deal with the situation yourself.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Don't worry.[A]
Bern's code says that every

his own consequences...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I must admit, he has done a superb

If you had not captured Aquleia,

This is nothing in comparison

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I am glad that I could be

May I ask a very important favor?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, anything that
I am capable of.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you find out anything
else about the Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[A]
If I discover anything new,
I will report to you immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you![A]
...Oh yes, I must tell
[ToggleSmile]you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,
exposing a sand bar that can be crossed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]A sand bar?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
If you were to go all the way
around to attack the castle, it[A]
would take much time.[A]
However, if the sand bar were
crossed, it would not take as long.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But please be careful.[A]
Rushing is not always the
best tactic to win a war.[A]
[OpenRight]Yes.
Thank you for your advice.[A]

Let her pass.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][FastPrint]What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Are you Niime,
the Hermit on the Mountain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So, some have begun calling me
that, have they?[A]
Then I must be that Niime.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hear you are capable of using
the ancient spell book that[A]
we found in this castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I should be able to.[A]
I have been studying the dark arts and
ancient magic for centuries now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that this spell can change
the climate and weather around the caster...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]It wouldn't be
entirely improbable.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then I order you.
Use the spell book and create rainfall.[A]
Make it rain so that the rivers will
overflow and push back that Etrurian[A]
Army that is advancing on us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well I can try, but frankly I
can't guarantee that it would work.[A]
Also, powerful spells like these can
only be cast once.[A]
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Silence![A]
All you must do is follow my commands.[A]
You were the one who came to us and said
that you wished to join our forces.[A]
Then make yourself useful.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere...[A]
We are getting closer to
Bern's army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since we are getting closer,
we are clashing with soldiers from[A]
Bern more and more often.[A]
It will not be long before we
engage in full combat with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish to ask you
something before we do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have been hearing rumors...[A]
That King Zephiel rose to the
throne because he killed his[A]
father, the former king.[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I could not believe it.[A]
You tried to stop him even by
casting away your nationality.[A]
If King Zephiel is such a mad
individual as the rumors say, then[A]
you would not have thought of[A]
doing what you did.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinevere,[A]
I accepted the Fire Emblem not
to use it in battle, but to try[A]
and find a use for it to end[A]
this war peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Therefore, please tell me
the truth about the rumors...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I... I'm sorry.
Please... give me some time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]... What is the matter?[A]
Princess Guinevere was running off...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]... No, it's nothing.
Did you want something?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have gathered some information.
We may have some trouble with this battle.[A]
A powerful dark magician by the name
of Niime resides in the enemy ranks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Dark Magician...
A Druid, probably.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She is apparently extremely learned in
ancient sorcery.[A]
She has much more knowledge than
any scholar could dream about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But we can't pull back now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
but we can always be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.
We must be wary![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is the spell ready?
Niime![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... I'm warning you for the last time.
I really have no idea what will happen...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just shut up and cast the spell![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sigh.... All right...[A]

You did this on purpose![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What are you talking about... I warned

[OpenMidRight]Quiet! Someone!
Throw her into the dungeon![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][NormalPrint]Yes sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][SendToBack]Sigh....[A]
[0189]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What... happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy, we have a report.
The rivers have apparently frozen over.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ice is so thick that knights
on horseback can cross them with safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh...[A]
Well, good, we can advance more
quickly now.[A]
Charge toward the castle gate![A]
[018A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x192]
I was told that this Goddess Statue
would bring me good luck...[A]
But I pray to it everyday,
and nothing happens.[A]
That con man tricked me!
Here, take it.[A]
Just looking at it
is making me angry.[A]
[018B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x198]
Hey, when I was playing outside,
a ring fell from the sky![A]
...God gave it to me?
No way! Probably someone[A]
riding on a pegasus or a
wyvern dropped it.[A]
Here, take it.
I prefer my dolls.[A]
[018C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x194]
Are you the Etrurian Army?
Sigh... Just the other day,[A]
Bern's army went marching by.
When will we have peace again?[A]
Here, take this.
Use it to end the war.[A]
[018D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18F]
That Martel who's guarding the castle...
He said he had some secret[A]
weapon to use against you guys.
I'd be careful if I were you.[A]
[018E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x190]
When it gets cold enough,
the rivers around all freeze over,[A]
and we can get to the village in
the east without much trouble.[A]
But it's not quite the
season, unfortunately.[A]
[018F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18D]
You seem to be strong.[A]
But I heard that somewhere there's
a man called the 'Sword Saint'[A]
who is unimaginably powerful.
[0190]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x196]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, are you the Etrurian Army
that the old lady was talking about?[A]
I heard for some reason, she was
originally planning to join you[A]
guys, but for some reason she
went along with Bern.[A]
What is she thinking?[A] 
[0191]
[LoadFace][0x1D4]
[ToggleSmile]Blast![A]
How could you have traversed

[OpenMidLeft]Finally I have been released
from the clutches of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Niime.[A]
I live in the mountains to
study arcane magic.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You say you were released.[A]
Did you not join Bern out of
your own will?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well I did,
but it was only a guise.[A]
Bern's army had something that I
wanted to study.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is that?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well well, that got you
interested, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Dragons you speak of...[A]
They are not the wyverns that
Bern's Dragon Knights use,[A]
but the strange troops that are
mixed in with Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
Those are the Dragons that were
supposedly defeated in the[A]
Dragon Human wars.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you know this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought that this was only another
war that Bern started at first.[A]
But then I began to see strange...
evil things among their troops.[A]
So I decided to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And did you find out anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only[A]
decipher so many of them.[A][.....]
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dark Dragon...[A]
That is the leader of the Dragons
that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Dragons are simply a much more
advanced species than us humans.[A]
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.[A]
However, there was one thing that
the Dragons lagged far behind the[A]
behind the humans in.[A]
The Dragons' reproductive system
was much less efficient than[A]
that of the humans.[A]
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had power to create more[A]
more Dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from
my research.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It can make more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon can create more
of its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[A]
I want to learn more about
the Dragons.[A]
Let me accompany your travels.[A]
I wield Dark Magic...[A]
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
We want to learn about
the Dragons as well.[A]
It may be dangerous,
but if that's okay with you,[A]
you're welcome to join us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
The enemy has arrived.[A]
They are on the other side
of the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]So, they've arrived.
It starts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain,
are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian Army is saying that
they would liberate us from Bern.[A]
In that case, we would gain
independence...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you really believe what
they say?[A]
What idiot would fight a war for
the sakes of others?[A]
Once they defeat Bern, they would
station themselves as the next[A]
dictator.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then it's better to be with Bern.
They're better at warfare.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Come now, we have more
immediate problems.[A]
We've got to get rid of the enemy
that's right in front of us first.[A]
Are the ballistae ready?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The archers are all at their
stations.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good!
Shoot at them from a distance.[A]
They'll be floundering around in
the dark in this powerful blizzard.[A]
Observe nature's wrath...[A]
[0195]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Such strong wing and hail...
I can't see 3 meters in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ilia's winters are always like this.[A]
Well, you can't complain if you're
fighting a battle in winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We must attack now so that Bern
doesn't have the time to recover.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That's true.[A]
It would be a disaster if the Dark Dragon
was really brought back to this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe the Dark Dragon
is in human form as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perhaps.[A][Clear]
Maybe all the Dragons are in human
form now.[A]
I've also heard stories of Dragons
in human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know anything specific,
but I have read in an ancient scroll[A]
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have heard about it,
have you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, only in legend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]'At the Winter of Ends, the laws
of nature were turned upside down.[A]
Day became night,
and summer became winter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,[A]
but one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist[A]
the planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who knows...[A]
Popular belief says that the laws[A]
of nature were twisted when the
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of[A]
magical power, but I have no idea[......]
what really happened, either.[A]
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the[A]
Ending Winter.[A]
It must be more than coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[0196]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x153][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x145]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
Other Pegasus Knight squads
are headed this way to[A]
assist us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
That would help.[A]
Too bad for the enemy...[A]
They'll be in a panic if they suddenly
get attacked from all directions when[A]
they can't see in this snowstorm...[A]
[0197]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x192]
You have come to such an
isolated area like this...?[A]
The prophecies were correct...[A]
The world is covered in darkness...
A single blade of wind will[A]
slice through the darkness
and the light will shine again.[A]
[0198]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18E]
I've pondered a lot about whether
I should join Bern...[A]
But I've made up my mind now.
Take this ring.[A]
It brings out your inner powers.[A]
...Please grant this land with peace.[A]

It's to the northeast.[A]

I can only wish you luck.[A]
The 'White Devil' Sigune

The Ilian Pegasus Knights fly

You can't see anything in the blizzard...
and then they suddenly appear out[A]
of the swirling snow. By then
it's too late...[A]
You're already dead...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
What did you discuss

[OpenMidRight]It'll get long if I tell you.[A]
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]... I have come to speak

... Is it all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I wanted you to know before

About the tragedies that have
that have occurred.[A]
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]

Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
He didn't kill his father to
get the throne?[A]
[OpenLeft]No...[A]
Our father was the first one who
tried to kill Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse
he was taking from our father.[A]
And so he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...
Why did...[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]The Dragons are indeed mysterious

What is the matter?[A]

Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Did I appear at
a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's okay.
Did you send the letter?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Yes. I read through it,
then sealed it and had it sent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... All right, thanks.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]... Why did the former king
try to murder his own son...?[A]
[01A0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][FastPrint]Well?
Have we got enough troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
We are requesting aid from Ilia's
Knight's but all of them except those[A]
that have direct orders from Lord
Murdock are hesitant to help us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Damn!
How could this happen...[A]
Ah, we had captured Zealot's wife and
his family.[A]
How about Zealot's group?[A]
Have they responded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
They have been traveling all over the
continent as mercenary knights, so we[A]
do not know their exact location.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Ever since Sigune's group was defeated,
all of Ilia's militia have been reluctant[A]
to attack the Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Blast!
Everyone, everyone is such a coward![A]
They would have me, advisor to the

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127][CloseSpeechFast]Are you all right?

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's all right,

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... I don't know.

Perhaps the enemy might leave,
or perhaps Zealot might return.[A]
We must have hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Where is Lord Zealot now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]In his last letter, he said that he

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...
We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
When we take this castle,
we can use it as a base to[A][Clear]
launch attacks on Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
May I ask the reason why Bern's
former king tried to murder[A]
King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
It was an arranged marriage to
strengthen the tie between Bern and[A]
Etruria.[A]
However, our father already had
a woman he loved at that time.[A]
She is my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The marriage between our father and[A]
Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Therefore, our father didn't
love Zephiel's mother and so[A]
always thought badly of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then is that why the former king
and Zephiel had a bad relationship?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.[A]
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.[A]
He grew to become a proud heir
to Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the
King try to...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Master Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]All right,
I'll be there in a minute![A]
[Clear]Princess Guinevere,[A]
I am sorry, but...[OpenMidLeft]No, it is alright.
Please be careful.[A]
[01A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]Brrrr![A]
I knew Ilia was cold,
but I didn't think it[A]
would be this cold![A]
And there's just snow
wherever you look![A]
[ToggleSmile]It's so pretty...[A]
Whoops, I don't have time
to contemplate.
Gotta' get the treasure...[A]
[01A4]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The blizzard is picking up...[A]
This might take much longer
than we expected.[A]
We should head for Bern as soon
as we take the castle.[A]
[01A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Big Sister Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany?
Why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I've been in the Etrurian Army.[A]
I was surprised when I heard that
Edessa got taken by Bern,[A]
but I knew you'd be okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Oh?
And why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were captain of the Fleet!
There's no way Bern could defeat you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]
Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]But I won't stay defeated by
Bern for long.
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,[A]
but if I joined you, I could[A]
fight Bern as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then are you going to
fight with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Really? Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does that make you
so excited?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]
I became a Pegasus Knight because
I wanted to be like you.[A]
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream.[A]

lies a spear that was used

[01AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere,
we will attack Bern now.[A]
So may I ask...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... The rest of the story.[A]
[OpenMidRight]King Zephiel was an outstanding pupil in
his studies, he was skilled in war craft...[A]
He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But still the former king
did not look kindly at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In fact...[A]
Our father began to hate Zephiel
because he grew to become such a[A]
brilliant and worthy youth.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...
is that supposed to mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father was a man of ordinary
skill and intellect.[A]
Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill
made our father cold towards him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Jealousy...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]And then one day, our father
told Zephiel that 'the next heir to[A]
Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What!
That's awful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel was very patient.[A]
He said that he did not mind even if
he did not gain the throne.[A]
But the people around us, who were
looking forward to Zephiel's ability[A]
to be a good king, would not allow
anyone else to be the heir.[A]
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Decided to kill King Zephiel...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel
a poisoned drink from his own hands.[A]
And that was the first and last cup
that Zephiel ever took from our father.[A]
After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.[A]
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... The former king never did
anything after that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's[A]
mother as traitors.[A]
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.[A]
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.[A]
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.[A]

Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Of course, my Lord.
I will not let you down.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
We will show them the power of Bern's
[ToggleSmile]main frontline army.[A]
Still... that general from the
Lycia Alliance Army made it this far.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]General Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, that's him.[A]
I wish to see how he fights...
by going up against him directly.[A]
[01B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, General Roy![A]
I have found you at last.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bishop Yodel![A]
What brings you out here all the
way from Etruria?[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I did some research after
receiving your letter.[A]
And I have come to the conclusion
that Bern has indeed resurrected[A]
[Clear][ToggleSmile]the Dark Dragon![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Is that true!?[A]
... But Hartmut defeated the
Dark Dragon in the war.[A]
How could Bern have brought
it back to life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Apparently Hartmut did defeat the
Dark Dragon, but he did not[A]
finish it off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Instead of killing it, he sealed
it away in the mountains of Bern.[A]
And the sword he used to seal
it was...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Sword of Seals?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, did you know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.
I studied a little...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Even if the Dark Dragon has broken out
of its seal, if we can obtain the[A]
Sword of Seals, then we may be able to
seal it again or kill it once and for all.[A]
That is the Church's conclusion, and they[A]
sent me to ask for your assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know where
the Dark Dragon is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my next point.[A]
As the fire-breathing Dragons
can change into human form, it is[A]
highly possible that the Dark Dragon
is as well.[A]
In fact, we currently have a suspect.[A]
The Dark Priestess that is always
at King Zephiel's side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Dark Priestess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
We have no solid evidence, but it[A]
is true that she appeared at around the
same time that the other fire-breathing[A]
Dragons started to appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their
power in gems called Dragon Stones to[A]
change into human form so that they could
adapt to this environment.[A]
In that case, it would not be surprising
if the Dark Dragon was in the form of[A]
human woman as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]In any case,
we have to go see her to[A]
confirm the truth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
I shall accompany you as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You would fight alongside us?
That would be most helpful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Also, take these.[A]
These are the Divine Weapons that the
Church found on its own.[A]
I have instructions to give them to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Divine Weapons too!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If the Dark Dragon has really been
released, then this is the greatest[A]
danger mankind has ever faced since
the Dragon Human wars![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
We will face it with all our strength.[A]
[01B5]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][CloseSpeechFast]It has been said for centuries that
the best swords choose their owners.[A]
The sword is in your hands now.
You were chosen by it.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]But it's only coincidence
that I'm holding it...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What we may think
as being coincidental...[A]
Even that might be part
of our fate.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Anyway, now that we have the
Sword of Seals, all we need to[A]
do is head for the King's castle.[A]
We must hurry![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...Right!
We have to defeat Zephiel![A]
[01C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So...
Murdock was defeated...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...I am sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...How is the Etrurian army
behaving?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They have captured the Temple of Seals.
They are now headed this way.[A][OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Then we shall face them
inside this castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes.
I will protect you to the death.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Not you.[A]
Brenya, I have a very important
task for you.[A][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Idoun.
Where is Idoun?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][NormalPrint]...Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will stay here and defend the
castle from the Etrurian Army.[A]
Idoun, you must escape and hide
until this battle is over.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]If his Majesty wishes.[A][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brenya, I want you
to escape as well.[A]
Protect Idoun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]What!?
Please![A]
Let me fight by your side![A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
...This will be a harsh battle.
I cannot afford to lose Idoun now.[A]
If Idoun were to be lost...
This whole war would be meaningless.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]But!
I, I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Enough, Brenya!
This is an order.[A]
Are you telling me that you cannot
follow your king's commands?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][FastPrint]No...
I'm not saying that...[A][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Idoun,
even if I were to fall...[A]
You understand, do you not?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes...[A]
I will 'free' the
world as you ordered.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.
I will not give up my dream now.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[01C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian Army has come...[A]
I will not let you invade the
throne room![A]
[01C5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]I shall protect this
device with my life![A]
[01C6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[ToggleSmile][FastPrint]This is the King's castle...[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy,[A]
Zephiel is residing in the throne
room at the center of the castle.[A]
However, there are some special
devices that protect the throne[A]
room when invaders appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What kind of devices?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]One of the captives said that
at the west end of the castle[A]
there are some switches that
need to be maneuvered first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It'll be a long detour...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.[A]
After hitting the switches,
you must hold the 'Gem' in[A]
in front of the throne room
to make it open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gem?
Is it the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have that with me.[A]
So I should head to the throne
room while leaving the switches[A]
to the others...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be the shortest way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But would the captives leak
that kind of information so easily?[A]
Perhaps it's a trap...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
The captive also said, 'The[A]
switches and the door are all defended
by Bern's most powerful warriors.[A]
Even if you knew how to get into the
throne room, you wouldn't be able to[A]
get there.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]We need to try, even if we're
going up against powerful enemies.[A]
We're pretty strong as well.
We won't lose![A]
[01C7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]So this is Bern's castle...
It sure looks sturdy.[A]
There must be riches beyond
belief kept in here![A]
[01C8]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF]
[ToggleSmile]This is the switch?
Nothing's happening, though...[A]
[01C9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF]
[ToggleSmile]This is the switch?
Nothing's happening, though...[A]
[01CA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x149][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have come.[A]
Hmph...how ironic.
A child, stepping in my path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Zephiel...
King of Bern...[A]
[MoveRight]I will ask you this.
Why did you start this war![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
I wish to end the age of man.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Humans...
Humans are filthy.[A]
They flock to those with power and
would not think twice about betraying[A]
trusted allies to obtain more power.[A]
You must have witnessed numerous
traitors in your travels.[A]
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Jealousy. Hate. Greed.[A]
Friends, even family members would be
driven to kill by these stupid emotions.[A]
Such emotions make fathers who try to
kill their sons to save their own flesh.[A]
As long as humans control, as long as
humans dictate, as long as humans[A]
exist... this madness will never end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]But look at what you are doing![A]
You are one of those humans who
control other humans![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You know how the Scouring ended.[A]
[OpenRight]The Dark Dragon was
defeated by Hartmut...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That was the mistake.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]Mistake?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Mankind should not have won.[A]
Just because the humans came out
victorious, the world came under[A]
their control and transformed into
a world of madness and evil, driven[A]
by accursed emotions![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Mistakes must be fixed with haste.[A]
I will give back the world to
the Dragons.[A]
I will free the world from the
evil grasp of men.[A]
History must be redone from the
beginning again to save this[A]
world from everlasting evil![A][OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
Is it true you resurrected
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You may see that for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You said you would give the
world to the dragons.[A]
Then rule by humans would just be
replaced with similar rule by Dragons![A][OpenMidLeft]The Dragons you see now are
weapons for battle.[A]
They have no 'self'.[A]
They have no cruel emotions to
be driven by, unlike humans.[A]
The world under Dragons' control
would be fair and peaceful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot agree that such a world
would be for the better good![A]
It is true that humans have many
evil emotions and do terrible[A]
things, but it has always been us
humans who have corrected them![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hmph...
You are indeed naive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have faith in mankind.[A]
I will not lose to a man who has lost
faith in people and even in himself![A]
[01CB]
[LoadFace][0x149][ToggleSmile]You shall not bar my path![A]
[01CC]
[LoadFace][0x149][ToggleSmile].. So you have defeated
me...[A][Clear]
But remember...[A]
My will shall never die...[A]
As long as humans retain
control, madness will persist...[A]
[01CD]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Zephiel has fallen...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]We've done it,
Master Roy.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]...Or have we.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not see the
Dark Priestess anywhere...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Hm...
She escaped.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...So it seems.[A]
[01CE]

[01CF]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]What...[.....]
What the?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Zephiel's sword...
it glowed![A]
It's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Exaccus...[A]
A sword that only the
King of Bern can use...[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Master Roy,[A]
the legends say that
when all of the Divine Weapons[A]
come together, the Dragon
Temple rises out of the ground![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The Dragon Temple...[A]
[OpenFarRight]It was the
Dragon's Headquarters...[A]
Or at least, that's what
the legends say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
That is correct.[A]
[OpenRight]So is the Exaccus
the last Divine Weapon?[A]
I thought Hartmut's weapon
was the Sword of Seals.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Maybe...[A]
The Sword of Seals could be something
separate from the Divine Weapons...[A]
Perhaps it is even more powerful...[A]
[OpenRight]More powerful...?
What powers lie in this sword?[ToggleSmile][A]
[01D0]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]The sword glowed again![A]
The light is pointing
to the south![A][SendToBack]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight]So the Dragon Temple lies
to where the light in pointing?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]If the legends are true,
then that would indeed[A]
be the case.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]...If the Dark Priestess is
indeed the Dark Dragon...[A]
There is a high chance
that she would be there...[A]
[OpenRight]All right.
Let's go to the Dragon Temple![ToggleSmile][A]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]... Thank you.[A]
I knew you had your own problems
with your own nation...[A]
But you helped us.[A]
I must thank you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I don't quite understand what you mean...
But if I have been helpful, then I am glad.[A]
[OpenRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Control over humans
by humans...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Zephiel's words?[A]
Perhaps he was right...
in a way.[A]
[OpenRight]...Has the Dark Priestess
been found?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No...[A]
Apparently she disappeared
before the battle.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]I see...[A]
Do you really think she's
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't know at all unless
I actually saw her.[A]
It's going to be difficult to find her
because she is said to be clad in[A]
a black robe all the time, and
no one has ever seen her up close.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
But the battle is now over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you saying!
The hard part has yet to come.[A]
We must help the land recover
from the war.[A]
There are people out there
who need our assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right!
We have work to do.[A]
The real battle is maybe
just beginning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
We are alive, so we must
think about the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No matter what hardships are to come,
I will never give up.[A]
We have to show that even humans can
construct a beautiful and peaceful world![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Master Roy, you will have
me at your side always![A]
Now, let us leave the castle
for now.[A][Clear]
We must spread the word of victory![A]

Please take care of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What are you going
to do, human?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We will stay here and face
the Etrurian Army one last time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Do you have the troops?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The Dragon Knights scattered around
the continent have all returned[A]
under our cause.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have a chance
of victory?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Our chances of winning are
not high.[A]
But we are the Bern Army,
the strongest force on the[A]
continent.[A]
We shall at least show them
our unbending will.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will...[A]
You humans are incompressible
to us at times.[A]
Would your will raise your
chances of winning?[A]
Very well.[A]
We all have our methods of
battle.[A]
[01E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Have you spread my
message?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
"Those who flee the army now will
not be tried guilty of fleeing.[A]
Whether to fight or to leave is
up to each his own."[A]
That was your message,
General Brenya.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]How many still
remain with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Almost all of the troops are
saying that they still wish to[A]
fight by your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All?
Our chances of victory are slim.[A]
I'm sure many of the troops have
family waiting for them.[A]
They must not feel pressured to
stay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are Knights of Bern,
my lady.[A]
We have no intention of bowing our
heads to Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I want you to expel those
who are injured and those who have[A]
young children or aged parents.[A]
They must not stay here.[A][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]But General Brenya...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is an order.
Understood?[A]
[01EA]

[01EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,
our troops are ready.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...Did the messenger return?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
...As we suspected, the enemy has
no intention of surrendering.[A][OpenMidRight]Did you make it clear that their safety
would be guaranteed if they surrender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
But they said,[A]
'We appreciate your offer,
but we will not surrender.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Bern already officially surrendered...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This person might understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x157][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere...[.....]
Do you understand why?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
...Bern recognizes itself as being the
strongest force in Elibe.[A]
Their pride would not allow them to
accept defeat without fighting.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]Master Roy!
The enemy is advancing![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]!
...We have no choice.[A]
We must fight![A]
Merlinus, send Princess Guinevere
to the back lines...[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft]No.
I will stay here.[A]

must listen to their calls.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]It is also said that the temple's
power protects the Dragon itself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is just my estimate, but
perhaps it means that the Dragons[A]
inside the temple have much greater
power than those on the outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
Our tactics against the Dragons
until now might not work?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
But perhaps if one worthy of using
the Divine Weapons uses one to its[A]
fullest potential, then we might
have a chance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We have no other good ideas.
All right.[A]
Then we'll choose those who have
the best skill to enter the temple.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Be careful who you choose.[A]
We might not be able to leave
once we're inside...[A]
[01F6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Temple...
The air is strange.[A]
Did the Eight Heroes fight under
such pressure as well?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C]Would you stand before us
again, humans?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What...
Who are you![A]
When did you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I am Yahn.[A]
I am the last remaining Dragon
of the Dragon Temple.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]The last dragon?[A]
You seem different from the
other dragons...[A]
Are you the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons who you have been fighting
with are War Dragons who know nothing[A]
but battle.[A]
And the Dark Dragon is something
completely different from me.[A]
I am a full-blooded dragon who fought
you humans in the faraway past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Different?[A]
Wasn't the Dark Dragon supposed
to be the leader of the Dragons?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon is an 'object'
that is meant to bring hope to us[A]
Dragons again.[A]
It is no leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.....]
Then what is the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems you have much to learn.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tell us![.....]
What is the Dark Dragon?[A]
We...I have to fully understand
my enemy before I fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...I have no reason to tell
you.[A]
And yet, I have no reason not
to tell you.[A]
What should I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...All right.[A]
I shall test you to see if you
are worthy of hearing the truth.[A]
I am deep inside the temple.
Fend off our attacks and come to me.[A]
Then I shall explain everything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're right here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What you are seeing is just
an illusion.[A]
If you wish to know the truth,
then come to me.[A]
If you prove yourself worthy of[A]
my time, then you shall hear
it all...[A]
[01F7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You...
Are you real this time?[A]
Or...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is but the entrance.
You have a long way to reach me.[A]
But you seem strong enough
not to die immediately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have gone through
many hardships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I see.[A]
Very well, I shall tell you a little
about the Dark Dragon.[A]
The Dark Dragon is not the leader of
the Dragons as you thought.[A]
The Dark Dragon was created to bring
us victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Created...?[A]
So it wasn't the Dark Dragon
making more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons you speak of are correctly
referred to as War Dragons.[A]
As I said before, they are different
from pure Dragons such as I.[A]
Indeed, the War Dragons are created[A]
by the Dark Dragon.[A]
And the Dark Dragon was created out
of the Divine Dragon, the most[A]
powerful of our kind.[A]
[OpenRight]Created out of the Divine Dragon?
Then the Dark Dragon is actually...[A]
The Divine Dragon agreed to become
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Agreed?
No.[A]
We destroyed its soul so that it would
follow our leader's every command.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]What...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]We desperately needed the power of
the Divine Dragon.[A]
Our entire species was at stake.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You needed the power of the
Divine Dragon...[A]
But...why did you have to
destroy its soul![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why, you ask.[A][.....]
If you want that answer,
then seek me out again.[A]
I shall witness your power
further...[A]
[01F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not bad, not bad at all.
I wonder how far you will come.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to go
on with your story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No matter how much we fought,
you humans just seemed to multiply[A]
endlessly.[A]
Eventually, we began to lose because
of the humans' sheer number.[A]
Therefore, we created the Dark Dragon
that would make War Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]War Dragons...
Dragons only meant for battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
But the Divine Dragons did not agree
with us.[A]
They said that would be defying the
laws of nature.[A]
As we were discussing how we could
persuade the Divine Dragons, they[A]
suddenly disappeared.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They most likely left us to prevent
us from taking advantage of them.[A]
We could not find the Divine Dragons,
but fortunately, we were able to[A]
capture one.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And that became the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
And that Divine Dragon, Idoun, was to
become the Dark Dragon.[A]
However, she felt hesitation in letting
the Divine Dragons and us other Dragons[A]
going on to bad terms.[A]
Hesitation...such nonsense is for humans
only.[A]
We have no need for it.[A][OpenMidRight]Then that hesitation worked
against you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Divine Dragon we captured was still
young, but we had no problem because[A]
it was good enough for our purpose.[A]
However, its heart was not with us.
It would not follow our commands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...
You destroyed its heart...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
We destroyed its soul to make it
follow our every command.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's...terrible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is enough for now.[A]
If you want to know more, then
show me more of your power![A]
[01F9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You have taken another step forward.
But the way is still long.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We shall still reach you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have a stout heart.
What do you wish to hear next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You succeeded in creating the Dark Dragon.
The Dark Dragon produced War Dragons.[A]
Then why did you lose to the humans?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed, the Dark Dragon continued to produce
War Dragons to use in the battlefield.[A]
We were able to turn the tables on
the humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, the humans soon found out
about the Dark Dragon.[A]
They concluded that their numbers would
would not be enough to defeat us.[A]
Therefore, they put their efforts into
constructing powerful weapons that[A]
would pierce our scales.
They are what you would call the[A]
the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That part is the same as
our legends...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most powerful and potent were
chosen out of the humans to wield[A]
their newly crafted weapons.[A]
They came and charged this temple.[A]
However, when the immense power of the
weapons and our power clashed near[A]
Bern, something unexpected happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The laws of Nature started to collapse.
Snow began to fall in mid summer.[A]
Stars shone in the middle of day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that the Ending Winter?[A]
I heard that happened because you Dragons
unleashed too much power into the world...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that how your legends go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The power in the Divine Weapons
were used to restore order in nature.[A]
That's what our legends say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All the bad things that happened are
all our fault.[A]
I would have expected you humans to
think like that.[A]
But the truth is what I said.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then the Divine Weapons were sealed
away so as not to let such a[A]
disaster happen again?[A]
Then all those traps that protected
them were to warn us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sealed them away?
That was a good decision.[A]
But they seem to be in
your hands right now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[A]
The weapons do not seem to have
as much power as they did in the past.[A]
They are unable to bring about
a disaster again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]The great disaster hurt us
Dragons greatly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The disaster was originally the reason
why we lost to the humans...[A]
I shall continue when you advance
a bit further...[A]
[01FA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]You have come here again.
You are doing better than I expected.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please continue the story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When the order of nature collapsed,
we Dragons took a fatal blow.[A]
The forces of nature weakened,
and it became difficult for us[A]
to retain our original Dragon form.[A]
Therefore, we decided to seal our
powers in gemstones and take the[A]
human form instead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those must be the
Dragon Stones...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Now we were utterly powerless against
the humans.[A]
In human form, we were just as weak,
no, even weaker than the humans.[A]
The humans took advantage of our
handicap and started attacking the[A]
Dragons that had taken human form.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why did you take human form?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In the new order of nature, the
human was the form that required the[A]
least energy to transform into.[A]
The Eight Heroes mercilessly crushed
us, helpless in our human form.[A]
I too suffered a deep wound.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you have hate for the
humans who wounded you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hate?
Only humans have such ridiculous emotions.[A]
We battled to maintain our species, and
we lost.[A]
That is all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, you humans might
lose this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Some human named Zephiel brought
the Dark Dragon back to life again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]!![A]
Then Zephiel did break the
Dark Dragon's seal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is correct.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]If you want to hear more, then show
me some more of your worthiness.[A]
[01FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yahn!
I know you're there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C]Hm...[A]
It seems that you did indeed
defeat Zephiel...[A]
You might make it far enough
to be able to fight me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What relation did the
Dark Dragon have to Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know that the founder of Bern
is the Hartmut, the leader of the[A]
Eight Heroes, do you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then do you know that Hartmut
didn't kill the Dark Dragon[A]
but only sealed it away?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
But I still don't know
why he did that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...
I see.[A]
The Eight Heroes eventually defeated our
leader, and they made their way deep into[A]
the temple to find the Dark Dragon.[A]
However, when they arrived at the Dark
Dragon's chamber, all they saw was a[A]
human girl, looking off into space.[A]
It was Idoun.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They didn't fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Dark Dragon had its soul destroyed
to follow our leader's commands.[A]
Since our leader had been killed,
there were no further commands to follow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then what happened
to the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Eight Heroes naturally hesitated.[A]
They had expected to see the most
powerful Dragon, but all they saw[A]
was a girl who wouldn't respond
even if spoken to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Dark Dragon still must be defeated,
so the Eight Heroes prepared for battle.[A]
The girl must then have reacted to their
attack.[A]
She changed into the Dark Dragon and
fought back, just like the War Dragons[A]
who have no heart.[A]
Hartmut then used a blade stronger than
the Divine Weapons and slashed at the[A]
Dark Dragon's scales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Sword of Seals![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know what you humans call it,
but that must be it.[A]
Anyway, when the sword cut through the
Dark Dragon's flesh, it suddenly fell[A]
unconscious.[A]
[01FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have come far.
I am in the chamber right in front of you.[A]
It has been long since I last met humans
in my true form.[A]
I have not left this place ever since
the war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You were always here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]One thousand years...[A]
Having survived the Scouring, I waited,
healing my wounds in the process.[A]
I waited for the resurrection of the
Dark Dragon that would bring hope to[A]
us Dragons again.[A]
And that time came.[A]
The Dark Dragon's seal was broken,
and I felt power flowing through my[A]
veins again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How does the Dark Dragon's seal being
broken make your strength recover?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragon Temple's power depends
on the Dark Dragon's, and thus the[A]
Divine Dragons' power.[A]
If the Dark Dragon were to be sealed,
then there is no way I could have[A]
recovered to full strength by using[A]
the temple's power.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]After my strength fully recovered,
I set out to look for the person who[A]
had broken the seal.[A]
I used my illusion to search him out
and ask his intentions.[A]
I did not wish to go outside in my
true form, knowing that you humans[A]
now ran the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait...[A]
I thought that Dragons in their
human form lost most of their powers.[A]
Then how are you creating this illusion?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This temple is for the Dragons.[A]
It is the only place that Dragons can use
a little of their power even in human form.[A]
I am a fairly powerful Dragon.[A]
Even in human form, as long as I stay in
the temple, creating illusions is easy.[A]
[01FD]
[LoadFace][0x14C]One thousand years...[A]
My strength has long
recovered.[A]
I can feel it...[A]
[01FE]
[LoadFace][0x14C][ToggleSmile]So, I have lost...[A]
Humans are truly
unpredictable...[A]

lies the Dark Dragon...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]...Roy...[A]

What's wrong, Fa?[A]
You look you're about
to burst into tears.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is..
Is Fa also an enemy...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When...[A]
When Fa gets big, will Fa
become a bad Dragon too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, Fa.[A]
Tell me what want to
say, slowly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That man said so...
Dragons and people can't live together...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you were living in Nabata
with people, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Dark Dragon is a
Divine Dragon like Fa is![A]
And you're going to fight
Dark Dragon, right?[A]
What about Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If Fa grows up...
And becomes like the[A]
Dark Dragon, then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't have to worry about
that.[A]
Even if you grow up, you'll
always be Fa.[A]
You'll always live together
with humans, and with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure![A]
And also, I actually want to
help the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Help?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Dark Dragon is not acting
on her own will.[A]
She had her soul destroyed.[A]
I...I don't want to kill
her, if I can avoid it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa doesn't get it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand when you
get a little older.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Hartmut posed a question.
And I'll give an answer to it![A]
[0200]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The Dark Dragon is in here...

I shall make the world a better place.
Why are you barring my performance?[A]

You were only told the world

The person who ordered you is
already dead.[A]

same words.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
But that was long ago...
I have been asleep for too long.[A]
In the darkness, I was dreaming...
An empty dream, white, colorless...[A]
But now I am awake.
His Majesty willed me so.[A]

[LoadFace][0x133][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]This is the end...
Finally, It will end...[A][ClearFace]
[0233]
[LoadFace][0x134][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Roy, concentrate.[A][ClearFace]
[0234]
[LoadFace][0x135][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I hope this'll
be the last battle.[A][ClearFace]
[0235]
[LoadFace][0x116][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I know I've become strong...
Now's the time to show it!![A][ClearFace]
[0236]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]I will not give up![A]
I have the sword of Hartmut,
who pitied you and did not kill you![A]
Everyone...
Leave the final blow to me!![A]
[0237]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]I don't want to defeat you...
But I can't leave things as they are![A]
Our history isn't all clean...
But it isn't all dirty, either![A]
I will fight and prove that![A]
[0238]
[LoadFace][0x14A][ToggleSmile]I...I...
Gah... I...[A]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What's happening...
The temple is starting to collapse![A]
Everyone!
Hurry outside![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
Leave the rest to me.
Now go!![A]
[023A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
You are all right![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
[ToggleSmile]But the temple is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released[A]
in the battles just fought.[A]
The building probably couldn't
withstand it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So times are changing again.
And...[A]
Who is that you are carrying
on your back?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x14B][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Her?
Oh, right.[A]
Merlinus,
I need to ask something of you...[A]
[023B]
And thus this conflict, called 
[023C]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[023D]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[023E]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[023F]
but never directly interfered 
[0240]
in their state affairs. 
[0241]
With the help of Roy, 
[0242]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[0243]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[0244]
with Guinevere as its queen. 
[0245]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[0246]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Princess Guinevere is to
be crowned today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't see her in her
royal garments yet.[A]
She must look beautiful
beyond words.[A]
Even when I first met her,
I couldn't believe that such a[A]
beautiful person existed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But the princess' hardships
are still to come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if she becomes queen
of Bern with Etruria's help,[A]
I'm sure there will be a lot of
rebellion and unrest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think that there might be
people who'll say that Princess[A]
Guinevere joined Etruria just to
seize the throne.[A]
She'll have to face them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But I think Princess
Guinevere will be fine.[A]
And then Bern will become
a much better nation than before..[A]
[ToggleSmile]She's just so smart...
And strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...
I think so too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What are you going
to do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
I'll return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we'll have to[A]
start rebuilding the lands
that were trampled on by[A]
the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...Nothing.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you're returning
to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?[A]
You're going back to Ostia,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.
I must take my father's place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm glad to hear that
you'll be staying in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because if you're in Ostia, then
I can go meet you any time I want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[A]
I don't know when,
but some day...[A]
I'll go pick you up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I...
I have to prepare, too..[A][Clear]
But...Roy...
I always...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
The ceremony's starting.
Come on, Lilina, we have to[A]
[ToggleSmile]go see Princess...
I mean, Queen Guinevere![A]
And pay our respects![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...I always...
What!?[A]
R-Roy, wait for me![A][ClearFace]
[0247]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere,
congratulations on your crowning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But my battle is only about
to begin.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
I had to rely on Etruria
to fulfill my task.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am grateful.[A]
However, I think that there will
[ToggleSmile]be people who will think that[A]
I joined Etruria just to seize
the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the most important thing now
is to rebuild Bern.[A]
I will try my best to gain the
people's trust by bringing[A]
Bern back to life.[A]
No matter how long it takes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If there is anything I can
do to help, please don't[A]
hesitate to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
Some day I might.
Roy, are you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you going to do?
Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No,
I will return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we have to start[A]
rebuilding the lands that were
trampled by the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You are returning to your homeland?
That is just like you.[A]
Still...[A]
Someone of your ability could easily
aim for high power in the Etrurian Court.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-Me!? No no no,
I have no such ability![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pherae's people are fortunate
to have such a gifted leader as you.[A]
[0248]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Princess...[.....]
I mean, Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Guinevere is fine.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Guinevere.
The ceremony is about to begin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[.....]
I will be there shortly...[A]
[0249]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy,
will you come with me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ever since I left Bern with the Fire
Emblem, you have helped me tremendously.[A]
I want you to see the path Bern will
take with my leadership.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
If it is all right with you, then
I will be glad to accompany you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let us go see a new Bern...
And a new age.[A]

[024A]
Later, in Arcadia...
[024B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x161][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Master Roy.
It has been a long time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I had business in these areas,
so I decided to stop by on the way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa will be glad to see you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I saw her earlier.
She is as energetic as ever.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She is being allowed outside
more these days.[A]
Perhaps that is why.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How is the girl
I sent here doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We succeeded in restoring
her soul, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...She still won't go
back to normal?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa sometimes takes her outside,
but she won't try to do anything[A]
on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We knew that the girl you sent here
was captured by the Dragons.[A]
Still, we did not try and rescue her.[A]
We feared that our kind would be
in danger if we showed ourselves[A]
in front of them again.[A]
But now, I wonder whether
my judgment was correct...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps it is because we
have begun to live with humans.[A]
I will make my best efforts to
bring the girl's heart back fully.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a first, I would like to see some
sign that her emotions are working...[A]
Like laughing or crying, or something...[A]
[024C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]
And that[......] is called[......] a[......]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]

just[......] laugh?[.......][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Laugh...?[......]This is to laugh?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where's [......]Roy? [......]Fa has to[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]tell Roy[......]

[0251]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]What's happening...
The temple is starting to collapse![A]
Everyone!
Hurry outside![A]
[0252]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
You are all right![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
[ToggleSmile]But the temple is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released[A]
in the battles that we just fought.[A]
Probably the building couldn't
withstand it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Master Roy,
this is the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's not over yet.
This is just the beginning.[A]
We have to help the land and
the people recover from the war.[A]
We have much work to do.
The real battle is just beginning![A]
[0253]
And thus this conflict, called 
[0254]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[0255]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[0256]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while,

You're that girl that was...![A][ClearFace]

Have we met before?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]What![A]
You have forgotten me,
of all people?![A]
That...must not be![A]
[02A6]
[LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]You're Princess Guinevere's...
Ha![A]
[ToggleSmile]So you betray your nation
and turn to the enemy.[A]
Disgraceful![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x12E][ToggleSmile]My loyalty is with
the princess.[A]
And so it shall
remain![A][ClearFace]
[02A7]
[LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]You...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x12A]General Narshen...[.....]
No, Narshen![A]
I heard everything
from Sir Gale![A]
Do you not...have any
honor left in you at all![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x142]Gale...! Dammit, is he
ever an eyesore![A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, it shall be fine...
Once I get rid of you,[A]
everything will be
shrouded in mystery...[A]
[02A8]
[LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]You're...[A]
[ToggleSmile]So being defeated
once wasn't enough?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x134][ToggleSmile]Zephiel was the one
who defeated me.[A]
Not you.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x142]Then I shall show you
my strength now![A]
[02A9]
[LoadFace][0x142]Well, if it isn't
General Percival, the traitor![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]
Joining you...was the biggest
mistake of my life.[A]
And now I shall repent
for it...by defeating you![A]
[02AA]
[LoadFace][0x147][ToggleSmile]You were one of Narshen's
troops.[A]
I heard the story from Gale.[A]
I do feel sorry for you,
but you are currently an enemy.
Come![A]
We fight![A]
[02AB]
[LoadFace][0x147][ToggleSmile]Miledy...
I don't want to fight you.[A]
But you are here.
It seems we have no choice.[A]
Come![A]
[02AC]
[LoadFace][0x147]So!
You are General Roy![A]
I have been looking forward
to matching blades with you![A]
[02AD]
[LoadFace][0x148][ToggleSmile]Miledy...
So you have chosen the[A]
[ToggleSmile]path with Princess
Guinevere.[A]
That is one way...
But I have chosen my path,[A]
[ToggleSmile]as you yours. I must
fight to defend it![A]
[02AE]
[LoadFace][0x148][ToggleSmile]You are a knight of Bern?[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you have chosen
the path with Princess Guinevere.[A]
That is one way...
But I have chosen my own path,[A]
[ToggleSmile]as you yours. I must
fight to defend it![A]
[02AF]
[LoadFace][0x142]Well, if it isn't
General Percival, the traitor![A][ClearFace]

Joining you...was the biggest

[ToggleSmile]Oh...
You've joined the Etrurian side.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x128]Captain Sigune...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x145]You know the Ilian Knightly

I won't go easy on you.[A]

[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina?[A]
Damn, you were supposed
to be dead by now...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x122]Leygance...
Why?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144]Times are changing,
my Lady.[A]
I'm just making sure
I don't get left behind.[A]
I'm not like Lord Hector,[A]
who was too foolish to
realize the change.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x122]Quiet!
You will not insult[A][.....]
my father any further![A]
[02B5]
[LoadFace][0x108][ToggleSmile]Leygance, you fool![A]
Are you not ashamed that
you betrayed Lord Hector?![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144]Barth... Shut up.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Lord Hector stupidly caused
his death.[A]
I do not plan on falling
with him.[A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x108][ToggleSmile]Why, you...![A]
[02B6]
[LoadFace][0x144]Bors! So you were
still alive.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
Taking over Ostia while
we weren't around...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Is that a problem?[A]
Then try and take it back
with your own strength and skill![A]
[02B7]
[LoadFace][0x1BD][ToggleSmile]General Leygance!
You shall rest here![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Ah, Bors' sister, is it?[A]
It's nice to be brave and all,
but can you really defeat me?[A]
[02B8]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]Bors! You returned![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x109]Causing a rebellion during
Lord Hector's absence?![A][Clear]
That is unforgivable![A]

You would betray me?[A][ClearFace]

you too are following

[LoadFace][0x10A][ToggleSmile]Perhaps it may seem that way
from the outside. But there is[A]
[ToggleSmile]no hesitation in my

[LoadFace][0x140][ToggleSmile]I am simply living

Anything can go unpunished

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for worrying about me,

[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
You were looking off into space again.[A]
We're in a battle.
You could get killed![A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just that...
We've come a long way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Long?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not distance-wise...[A]
It's just that everything seems to
be changing so quickly.[A]
Do you remember the time when you
came to Ostia to study?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
2 years...[A]
Wait, was it 3 years ago?[A]
[OpenMidRight]At that time, your father and my
father were still well.[A]
Lycia was so peaceful...
No one would have imagined a war.[A]
...It all seems as if it were 10
years ago.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I sound so foolish...[A]
There's no way we can go back
there anyway...[A]

Roy...
I'm sorry about the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was on some
nostalgia trip, remember?[A]
We're in a war...
Of course things won't be the same...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, some things will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be at your side,
and you'll be at mine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We can't go back to the past,
but we can shape the future.[A]
Then we should work to make
a future the same as, or even[A]

better than the past, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hehehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy, you're showing off...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Do you think so?[A]
Yeah, I was thinking that didn't
sound like me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter, Marcus?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not good.
Not good at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's not good?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The youths these days, their fighting
has much to be desired.[A]
It isn't all of them, but most of them
seem pampered in my eyes![A]
We must make stricter exercise plans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I don't think they're pampered...
They're all doing their best.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No![A]
Master Roy,
you are too soft on them.[A]
I shall go and show them
an example![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you sure you have to
go on your own?[A]
You're not, you know,
young anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nonsense![A]
I may be old, but I shall not
lose to the young ones yet![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...okay.[A]
But you're still not young any more,
so watch out for your health.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, of course.
Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy is so thoughtful...[A]
Now look at those other young ones
compared to him...disgraceful![A]
I must help Master Roy in their
place.[A]
[0310]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy, I still think that
we should make our rules stricter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Stricter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
And we expel those who aren't
doing their job properly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Although our army will be small,
we will have a team of elites.[A]
That way, we can fight more
efficiently.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Marcus.[A]
That's not a good idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh...
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who's going to choose whether
someone is not doing their job?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, that would
be you, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But some people might be
working when I'm not looking.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Well, in that case...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are also people supporting us
outside of the battlefield, and there[A]
also those whom we don't use because
of my decisions who haven't yet had[A]
a chance.[A]
You want to simply expel them all?[A]
We have many people who joined us
with strong beliefs.[A]
We can't just tell them to leave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Marcus, we have to trust them more.
They're our comrades, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You are right.[A]
I was mistaken, Master Roy.
Your thoughts are noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, it's kind of strange
hearing you praise me like that.[A]
You're usually scolding me most
of the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Am I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy...
He has gotten so bold...[A]
He can now certainly live on
his own.[A]
My role is almost finished...[A]

[0311]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C]
[OpenMidLeft]Marcus, is something wrong?
You seem not well these days.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
When I think of a good time
that I should retire...[A]
Well, aging certainly
isn't a fun thing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retire?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The young soldiers have grown strong.
Perhaps it is the right time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Marcus.
What are you saying?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am old...[A]
It wouldn't be for your benefit
that an old man like me by your side.[A]
I should give way for the next
generation...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I should be retiring soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No![A]
I order you to stay![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll apologize if you're angry
about what I said the other day.[A]
So don't say you'll retire.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But an old man like me...
I shouldn't be in battles anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still have lots of things
that I need to learn from you.[A]
But if you leave...
Who can I turn to for advice?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy...
You trust this old knight so much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't say you'll retire...[A]
I still need your help from
now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I shall serve you till my death...[A]
[0312]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy,[.....]
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Just call me Roy.
We grew up like brothers, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I appreciate your kindness,
but rules are rules.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?[A]
You've suddenly become
a faraway person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you saying?[.....]
I'm right here in front of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not what I mean.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, I know.[A]
But I must not slack off in areas
like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well then, let's go![A]
We have a long ways yet,
Master Roy.[A]
[0313]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wolt!
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, that conversation
was settled.[A]
More importantly, this
is a battlefield.[A]
You never know where
enemies are hiding.[A]
Please be sure to keep
on your guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt...[A]
You're starting to sound like
Merlinus and Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Am I?
Thank you![A]
That is such praise.[A]
My goal is to become a loyal
servant like them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nothing.[A]
Leave me alone for a while,
will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...?[A]
[0314]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not look well.
Is there something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Well, actually there is.
Would you mind if we talked about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!
Of course![A]
I'll do my best to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You see, I'm kind of angry
at this person in the army.[A]
What he's saying is true
and makes sense, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
What you understand intellectually
and what you feel are two different[A]
things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.[A]
My feelings don't agree
with what I understand.[A]
And then I start to get mad and
I feel like telling him about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then do so![A]
Keeping it inside of you is
bad for your health.[A]
And besides, you are at a
stressful position.[A]
No one would get angry if you
spill it out once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
If you want, I can go talk to the
person.[A]
Even if the whole world turns against
you, I will always be at your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, okay.
Thanks Wolt.[A]
I feel better now.[A]
All right!
We have to get moving![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly, Master Roy![A]
[ToggleSmile]...By the way, I can tell the
person you're mad at and have a[A]
little discussion with him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
...Who was it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He's closer than you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Where?[A]
.......
...Is it...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yup![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
[0315]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy,
how should I move next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes.[A]
You should...
...um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's just that...
It feels strange to give you orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
You are this army's leader.
You are supposed to give orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, you mustn't soften up.[A]
If the leader gets soft, so
do the troops.[A]
You are the general leading 
this army, and I am a squad[A]
leader in your army.[A]
So you must be strict, as a
general should be.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good.[A]
Now, General Roy,
what is my next move?[A]
[0316]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, General Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I can't.
We must keep moving.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rushing will only
bring failure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not rushing.[A]
I won't try anything impossible.
But we must move as quickly as we can.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The quicker we move,
we can reach more people in need.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, that's true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We are fighting to win this war.[A]
However, if we focus only on winning,

and ignore those people need help,[A]
is that a true victory?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I'm sorry...
I shouldn't be so outspoken.[A]
Have I angered you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm glad.
I was too focused on winning the battle.[A]
You are already becoming a great leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But...hearing that from
you is encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[0317]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]What are you going to do
after this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Do you already think
you've won?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
We must rebuild Etruria,
so I will return there first.[A]
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was just wondering if[ToggleSmile] you could teach
me again once the war has ended.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like the time in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
There's no need for that anymore.
You have become a wonderful leader.[A]
There is nothing more I can teach
you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, you must have confidence.[A]
Troops will not follow a leader who
does not even have confidence in himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is the last thing
I can teach you.[A]
From now on, you are not
my student.[A]
You are my colleague and
friend.[A]
If there's anything I can
help you with after the war,[A]
I would be glad to assist you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
I will always be on your side.
Never forget that.[A]
[0318]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sophia?[A]
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Today...
You shouldn't strain yourself...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]In battle...
There is a bad omen...[A]
Please stay out of the front lines...[A]
[OpenMidRight]![.....]
...All right.[A]
But I don't think I can follow
your warning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When I go up front...
It's because I trust the others.[A]
I can't be hiding in the back,
fearing injury.[A]
I have to fight alongside the
others.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for warning me,
but...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0319]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sophia?
Did you feel something again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I just wanted to apologize...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apologize?
To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About the other day...[A]
I told you that I could sense a bad
omen in the middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...[A]
You have such a burden...
And I said something...[A]
that would worry you more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm actually glad that you told
me.[A]
I was more careful that time.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you hadn't told me that,[A]
I probably wouldn't have been as
careful as I had.[A]
I could have been hurt badly.[A]
So thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So if you sense something from
now on, can you tell me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[031A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...
I must tell you something...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My power...
It is not very strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can see the future...
But it is only a vague image...[A]
Something truly powerful...
I cannot see...[A]
I just wanted to tell you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Something truly powerful?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
If I could not sense something
very powerful...and if you were[A]
to be hurt because of it...
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.
But I'll be fine.[A]
When the time comes, we'll
manage to do something about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sensing the future is an
amazing thing.[A]
We could prevent disasters
before they even occur.[A]
But I won't be too reliant on
your power, so don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to see you smile more
than your power.[A]
I'm sure we'll face more hardships
as we go along...[A]
But the least we could do is keep
our spirits up, right?[A]
Let's go![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Thank you...Master Roy...[A]
[031B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Phew, I've finished outlining
the troops' positions...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
Oh, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
You have a strange look on your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just that I was a little surprised
that you came up and spoke to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...[A]
I never see you speaking
with other people.[A]
You don't like talking
that much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It isn't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's just that I like talking with
other things more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Other things?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The breeze, the trees,
the sky, the brooks...[A]
They are all speaking
to us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
If you listen, you'll hear
them.[A]
You can't hear them because
you're not listening.[A]
See you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
I thought you had
something to tell me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Be sure to listen to nature,
and you'll hear all sorts of voices.[A]
You'll feel better after that.
If you're stressed all the time,[A]
you won't be able to hear anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sue...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Was she trying to cheer me up
because I was tired...?[A]
[031C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for cheering
me up the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You look better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your feel...
It's become better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My feel?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It has become softer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?
I can't really tell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps things like these cannot be
recognized by those who work the[A]
land as compared to those who run
through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]....[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's the first time
I've seen you smile.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Your smile has a good 'feel'
to it too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
Thank you.[A]
[031D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]What are you going to do
when this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll return to Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But the Kutolah clan
was destroyed by Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We'll gather everyone together again.[A]
Perhaps there is no more Kutolah clan,
but not everyone in the Kutolah is dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
I guess that's right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was just thinking that if you
don't have any place to go, you[A]
can come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pherae...
Your hometown.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right...[A]
It's not a huge city, but it's
a nice and peaceful place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But my heart is in the
plains of Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, okay.[A]
But if you ever change your
mind, just tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks for cheering me up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're very welcome.[A]
[031E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]What's the matter, Master Roy?
Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I was just thinking that you seem
so...free of worries.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey!
...Are you making fun of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No!
I'm envious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I still think I'm being
made fun of.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm not making fun of you.[A]
You see, I have to always show people
that I'm happy and confident because[A]
I'm the leader.[A]
But I often get depressed or become
worried.[A]
Oh, I wanted to ask you, is there
some kind of tip that you can give[A]
me to stay happy like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tip?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You know, something to do or a
certain mindset you should be in,[A]
or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
Eat well, sleep well,
and laugh well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Is that all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Probably.[A]
That's all you need to enjoy
life, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
Maybe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think you're thinking
too deeply.[A]
Well, probably, you have to because
you're in such a position...[A]
Anyway, I don't think it's as
complicated as you think.[A]
[031F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]You said you're a Pegasus Knight
in training, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How come you're in an army
outside Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the rule.[A]
If you fight outside Ilia, you'll gain
things you wouldn't be able to inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Foreign fighting styles,
foreign culture...[A]
And of course, money.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Then wouldn't it be a hindrance
if you stay in this army so long?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?
No, of course not![A]
There's no other army that's traveling
all over the place like this.[A]
It's great training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
Okay, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...
Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks![A]
[0320]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]Thany, what are you going to do
when this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
Well... First off, I'll
probably go back to Ilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your hometown?
I'd love to![A]
I wanted to see it once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it's not a huge city like
Ostia, so you might be disappointed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My hometown is probably more
countryside than yours.[A]
Plus it snows a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then everything's fine, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll look forward to going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure.[A]
If you like it, you can stay
as long as you want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy is so nice...[A]
Inviting a mercenary like me to his
hometown, and saying I can stay as[A]
long as I want..[A]
Wait...
Does that mean...?[A]
No no, don't get cocky...
But still...hmm...[A]
[0321]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]Wha-!?[A]
[OpenFarRight]L-Lalum...![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I'm glad I found you!
I want to show you something.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]W-Wait!
Calm down first...[A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]So...What was it you wanted?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Sooo![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Wait wait!
I can hear you from here![A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]I've come up with
a new dance,[A]
and I want you to see it.
It goes like this...[A][Clear]
Well?
Well?[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's very nice.
I think you're a very good dancer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Is that it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You know...
Isn't there more?[A]
Like, 'You look beautiful' or
'Your hair looks great today'[A]
or something...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uhm...
I better get going...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey![A]
[0322]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]L-Lalum...![A]
I don't think you should on to
people like that so much...[A]
People might have misunderstandings.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]But Roy...
...[A][Clear]
!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Eeek!
There's an enemy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Enemy!?
Where![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know!
But I heard the bushes rustle..[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]L-Lalum!
Calm down...[A]
I can't move if you're grabbing
on to me like that...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I'm going to die!
But...it's okay.[A]
If I can die for Master Roy,
it would be my only wish now.[A]
You, hiding over there!
Come out![A]
Our love is eternal,
and can never be broken![A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]P-Please, can you get
off of me so I can fight..[A]
[0323]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lalum...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you are!
I have another dance to show you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy...?[A]
Are you...trying to avoid
me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah...[A]
N-No!
Not at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes you are.[A]
As soon as I came,
you stepped back.[A]
You're already prepared
to dodge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You're imagining things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your eyes are wandering...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
You don't like me...[A]
You don't want to see my dancing
at all![A]
That's it![A]
[OpenMidRight]T-That's not true!![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Really!?
Thanks![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A]
[0324]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmmm....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh!
Alan.[A]
Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you
worrying over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was just thinking how
to move our troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How to move the troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The enemy is growing stronger all the time,
so good methods quickly become obsolete.[A]
I was wondering how to effectively break
through their defense lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's easy, Master Roy!
Leave it to me.[A]
I shall have their defense
shattered in no time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[A]
But I don't want to put anyone
in danger either.[A]
There has to be a better way...
I'll think some more.[A]
[0325]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, I have an idea
to break the enemy's defense...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
First, we save our best troops and use the
others to clash with the enemy's front lines.[A]
Then we shall find a weakness.[A]
Please, leave that role to me
and my squad![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But that group will be
in great danger...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We might have some casualties,
but we can win the battle![A]
Besides, I am not so easily
defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Alan,
I can't consider that idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't use a plan that we know
will have casualties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Master Roy, casualties
cannot be avoided in a war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think they can be.[A]
I might sound naive, but I don't
consider a victory with casualties[A]
to be a true victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A true victory...[A]
Can there be truth in a victory
of war?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think there can be.[A]
That's why I want to come up
with a good plan.[A]

[0326]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still thinking,
Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I can't think of a good plan yet...
But not your plan, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I understand,
Master Roy.[A]
But if there's anything I can do,
please tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I honestly still cannot decide whether
there is such a thing as true victory.[A]
But if you believe it, then I will
support you with all my strength.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Alan.[A]
I'm sure there will come a day when
you'll understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I shall look forward
to that day![A]
[0327]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I...couldn't see you,
so...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh.
Is that all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that is not all,
Master Roy.[A]
You are this army's leader.
You must watch for your safety more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, you're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I promise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0328]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, if I may
suggest something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How about if you stay out of the
front lines for a while?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you are thinking,
but please understand.[A]
An army's leader is crucial.[A]
If the leader is lost, so is
the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...[.....][A]
[OpenMidRight]But I don't think anyone would listen
to me if I only keep myself safe and[A]
start telling people what to do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true![A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not particularly smart, and I
don't have much charisma either.[A]
So I have to gain trust by experiencing
the pain that everyone else is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps I'm not meant to be a leader.[A]
Perhaps it's just how I am.[A]
[0329]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Lance, I've been thinking about what
you said, but I still think that I[A]
should stay up front.[A]
I know you were suggesting it for
my sake, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, perhaps I was too focused on my own
opinions.[A]
If you believe that your way is the best,
then it is best to pursue that path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
It's encouraging to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]However, you made one mistake
the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I did?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You said, "I'm not particularly smart,
and I don't have much charisma either."[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes, I did say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]That's the part about you that people
like.[A]
No one would give his life to someone
who has no charisma at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
If I may also add a comment, be sure
to keep that pure heart.[A]
As long as you do, our troops will
follow you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'll try.
Thank you, Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I am glad to be of
assistance.[A]
[032A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Ahh!
Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What!
What's wrong, Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You look wonderful in that
outfit today![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And I was wondering what in the world
happened when you screamed like that...[A]
Is that all?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Klein![A]
In this army, everyone is just so
aesthetically handicapped![A]
You truly shine when you are among
them, Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine, you only think that
because I'm your family...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No![A]
There is no one else in the world who could
match you.[A]
Perhaps General Percival has more authority,
but you will always be most beautiful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Clarine, a fine lady wouldn't
say things like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it is true.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I will try harder
if you tell me to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, do so.[A]
[032B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine, come over here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Klein?
How do you fare today?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not too well, I'm afraid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is true that you said harsh things
to the cleric and made her cry?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I did not make her cry.
She is the one who just stared crying.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...So it's true that she
did cry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is her fault!
She was sucking up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]She was healing your wounds
before I got the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Clarine![A]
[OpenMidRight]But I wanted to heal your injuries
so that you would be proud of me[A]
and would say that I was being a
great help, and...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But I was proud of you.[A]
I was thinking that my naive little
sister's so grown up now...[A]
But now that you've done this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'll never do it again![A]
Please don't hate me, Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about.
I'll never hate you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you, Klein![A]
[032C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I... I don't want to go back to
the mansion after the war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
Father and Mother are anxious
for us to return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to meet Father and Mother...[A]
But if I return to the mansion,
I would just be a doll again.[A]
I would never see the outside world,
and I would only be concerned[A]
about decorating myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that is how most Etrurian
ladies are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know...[A]
But becoming the most elegant in
Etruria does not seem as appealing[A]
as it once did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's because you're growing up
and maturing, Clarine.[A]
If you stay at the mansion, you could just
live your life without doing anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it would be so horribly
boring![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed...
All right, then here's what we will do.[A]
Once this war is over, we will first
go back home and show Father and Mother[A]
that we are safe and well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then we can discuss your future
and what you want to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I already know what I want
to do![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will become a Sorcery General
like General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
As the Sorcery General, I will help your
work as the Archery General, and then we[A]
shall always be together![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...let's try and be
a little more realistic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it would be so wonderful to see
us both in the elegant uniform[A]
of the Etrurian Generals...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...[A]
Well, you're still a little
girl, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[032D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Oh!
We certainly do meet a lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is not 'you.'
I am Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I have always wanted to tell
you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]It is about how you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]??[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You actually do have quite an attractive
face.[A]
Of course, it would come nowhere near
my beloved brother Klein, but you are[A]
quite impressive for a commoner.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Therefore, I can use my advanced
Etrurian esthetic sense and make you[A]
into a truly handsome noble...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! Wait!
Where did he go?[A]
I was not finished speaking to him!
So he is just a tramp after all![A]
[032E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There you are!
I won't let you go this time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Knock it off.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
That is no way to respond
to someone's kindness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're starting to get on
my nerves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
Insulting a lady like that...[A]
That...is not how a proper
Gentleman...should act...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight]... ...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...All right, I'm sorry.
...Don't cry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm not...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...I know he is not to blame...
But why am I acting this way...?[A]
[032F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You dropped this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Oh, my ribbon...[A]
[ToggleSmile]You brought it to me.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Um...[A]
I just realized...
I don't know your name...[A]
Would you please tell me your name,
if it would not be any trouble?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Rutger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
I never even thanked you for
saving me...[A]
It is no wonder you don't
like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you for rescuing me that
time...[A]
I know it is already too late,
but if you would accept my thanks..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Not like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't try something you're
not used to.[A]
You're good at screaming,
so why don't you do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What!?
What do you mean by that!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you go...
That's more like you.[A]
Come like that and make me
laugh once in a while, Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
[0330]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight]Excuse me,
would you mind sitting still?[A]
I'll heal your wounds for you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's a kid like you doing
in the battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you lost?
Where are your parents?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!!!
You infidel![A]
Do you have any idea who...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah yeah, you're some kid of
some high rank nobility, right?[A]
That still doesn't explain
why you're here, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!!!
You filthy...![A]
Listen in awe![A]
I am Clarine of the Reglay family
of Etruria![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Then you're Lord Pent's...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you know my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein's little sister...[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
You know Klein too!?[A]
Who...are you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing.
Forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's not nothing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Clarine, was it?
Be careful out there.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
Wait![A]
...
Who is he...?[A]
[0331]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...So I'm telling you to speak!
Who are you?[A]
Keeping quiet won't benefit you
in any way![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you ever shut up?
Gimme a break, kid...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Fine.[A]
Well, Miss Clarine, I don't really
approve of girls going around chasing[A]
after guys' asses.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What!?
You have such a foul mouth...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
You don't want to be around
someone like me, now, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will not be fooled.
You are just trying to drive me away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Geez, she's not cute at all...
Are you really part of that family?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's it!
I want to ask about my brother![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dammit, I'm falling into her pace!
Cunning kid...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Wait!
Wait, I say![A]
[0332]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...All right, you win.
I'll tell you.[A]
So just stop following me everywhere..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Finally, we understand each other.
Please begin, I am listening.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's really not that big of a deal...[A]
It's just that I once worked for your
family as a pit fighter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?
Then...[A]
Are you Dieck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I always wanted to meet you, Dieck![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You saved my brother's life![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who told you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Everyone!
My father, my mother, my brother...[A]
I grew up hearing all these good

things about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]When you left, I was still little...[A]
I remember that I always regretted
not being able to see you.[A]
But now, here we are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...
Well, now you've seen me.[A]
Satisfied?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Then you'll stop hovering
around me wherever I go, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'll follow you everywhere![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you saved my brother's life, then
that means you are an important person[A]
to me as well.[A]
And I want you to tell me what my
brother was like when he was young...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I don't think so.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh!
Wait, Dieck![A]
I won't let you go![A]
[0333]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Oh?
You are...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, you must be Lady Clarine,
princess of the Reglay family.[A]
I am Lance, knight of Pherae.[A]
We are honored to have one of
your stature with our army.[A]
Please forgive any impudence you
may have experienced so far.[A]
We are in a war, and people are
uptight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Yes, I shall forgive that for you.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is for you, and it
makes you very special![A]
All right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, thank you, my lady.
Now, let me take your hand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My...[A]
You have much respect for a
countryside knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am honored.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Of course, you are still nothing
compared to our knights.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive my lack of prowess,
my lady.[A]
[0334]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Clarine, is there something
I can get for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]As the princess of the Reglay family
I order you to protect me from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That means...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are a little weak to be defending
me, to tell the truth...[A]
But since we are in these conditions,
I will settle with you.[A]
You must stay by my side and defend me
at all times.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If Master Roy orders it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
I am ordering you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I may object, my lady, I cannot
follow those orders even if they[A]
are from you.[A]
A knight must serve his master,
and only his master.[A]
One who forgets that can no longer
be called a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I know that![A]
I was just testing your loyalty
as a knight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my lady.
Forgive my rudeness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Well, anyway, you have passed
the test.[A]
Be proud of it![A]
[0335]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you are not my knight...[A]
It is true that we are a princess and
a knight, am I correct?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]T-Then...[A]
I shall hereby permit you to kiss
my hand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, thank you, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lance, you do understand, do you not?[A]
This is to make clear the difference
in our status.[A]
There is no more meaning to it than
that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Of course...[A]
You could be a little more...
disappointed...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something,
my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No!
Nothing![A]
[0336]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me? Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you dressing yourself
in men's clothes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it strange...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course!
A lady must be wearing elegant dresses.[A]
A true lady must be dressed properly[A]
when they fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really...?
No, I suppose you're right.[A]
I don't know anything about
such matters...
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then, I suppose I can
teach you everything I know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? N-No![A]
I wouldn't do well in such things...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous!
A lady must always be beautiful.[A]
No gentleman will ever at you
if you look like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]D-Do you think so...[A]
Well...she is offering to help me...
All right![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please teach me, Lady Clarine!

[0337]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]So...
Dorothy, what do you usually do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm pretty busy outside
the battlefield.[A]
I help cook meals and stuff...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?![A]
You can leave dirty jobs like
that to that lowly Merlinus person![A]
[OpenMidRight]L-Lowly?
Master Merlinus is lowly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How do you take care of
your hair?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wash it with water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!?
I can't believe it...![A]
Here, use this.[A]
You must wash your hair with it
[ToggleSmile]three times a day![A]
Understood?
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]T-Three times?[A]
Well...
It looks really expensive...[A]
I appreciate it, but it would
be wasteful if I used it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you saying!
I am offering it to you.[A]
Go ahead, take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Well, thank you, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Also...
You should change the way you speak.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Could you not speak more like me,
with a refined and elegant tone?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...okay...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, what a beautiful day it is![A]
[ToggleSmile]Would you care for a cup of tea
and crumpets?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This will take a lot of work...
Well, first, you must learn how[A]
to take care of your hair, how
to choose your dresses, dance[A]
steps, how to turn down offers
from men...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That much!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.
You mustn't give up so easily![A]
The way to a refined lady
is a tough one indeed![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[0338]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...[A]
Nothing seems to have changed.[A]
No one seems to be noticing.
So maybe I should just give up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry!
I know you were just trying to help me...[A]
But it's not your fault![A]
You know, with me, the base isn't very
good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy![A]
That is what's wrong with you![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen to me.[A]
A fine lady must have confidence in herself.[A]
No matter how much you dress up, if you do
not have faith in yourself, it will all be[A]
in vain.[A]
You must not degrade yourself like that.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have confidence in yourself!
It is me who is teaching you.[A]
Of course you will
become a fine lady one day![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, thank you,
Lady Clarine...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...And...[A]
We are friends now,
[ToggleSmile]are we not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me 'Lady' Clarine.
Just call me Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
Okay then, thanks, Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A-Ahem!
Today we shall go over how to drink tea![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right![A]
[0339]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Fa?
...What are you looking at...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You grew up a little.[A]
[OpenMidRight]R-Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
Why, why?
Fa always stay the same![A]
You were the same as Fa before![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am half Dragon...
so I grow slowly...[A]
But you... grow even
more slowly than me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why does Fa stay little?
Why doesn't she grow up like you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are a full-blooded Dragon...[A]
A Dragon's lifespan...is close to
eternity...[A]
I have human blood in me...so I
grow at a different speed than you...[A]
Do you understand...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand...[A]
When you grow up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When will Fa grow up?
Soon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yay![A]
[033A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmmmmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmmm...[A]
Sophia, when is Fa gonna
grow up?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa's not growing at all...
Fa wants to be a grown up![A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
You can live...for a very long time...[A]
Even when I become old and die...you
will still live on...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
No! No no no!
You won't die![A]
Nooooo!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Waaaaah...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa...I'm sorry...
Don't cry...[A]
I feel the same way you do...[A]
But...[A]
That is what it means...
to live for eternity.[A]
[033B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D]
[OpenMidLeft]Sophia?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa was scared that you would grow up and
not want to play with her anymore...[A]
Fa always wants to be with you!
Fa wants to play hide-and-seek and tag[A]
[ToggleSmile]and lots of other fun games.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa...[A]
Don't worry...
I'll always...be your friend...[A]
I'll always be with you...
All right...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really!? Yay![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
We'll always...
be together...[A]
[033C]

[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene![A]
Look, look!
A butterfly!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa, shouldn't you be doing
something else?[A]
Didn't Master Roy give you
an order to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy's orders are no fun.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa, you should be doing
what you're told.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aww...[A]
But Fa doesn't want to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Er...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Say sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa's sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, Fa.[A]
You promised Roy you would
do what he asked, right?[A]
If you make a promise,
you have to keep it.[A]
Okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good girl.[A]
Well then, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[033D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B]
[OpenMidRight]Come here, Fa.
I'll braid your hair for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you like having
your hair touched, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes![A]
...Igrene,
is Fa gonna get pretty?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
You have such lovely hair...[A]
You'll become very, very beautiful
when you grow up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A]
Hey, Igrene?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa, hold still.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What's wrong?[A]
Do your hands hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry...[A]
I was just remembering my daughter.[A]
She was a very attractive little girl,
much like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened to her?[A]
[OpenMidRight]She's gone...
She went to a faraway place.[A]
[033E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were talking about your
little girl the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She came to play with Fa.[A]
When Fa was all alone in her room,
she came with Sophia to play and[A]
and tell Fa about the outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]She said you were the
'Guardian'.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
She stopped coming to play
with Fa.[A]
Fa asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.[A]
Is it Fa's fault?[A]
Was Fa a bad girl to her?[A]
Did Fa make her angry and
go to the faraway place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...that's not the case.
She was never mad at you, Fa.[A]
She just can't play with you
anymore, but...[A]
She'll always be very fond of
of you, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...of course.[A]
[033F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106]
[OpenMidLeft]La la laaa...
Oh! It's Sue![A]
[OpenMidRight]You look like you're having
lots of fun, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,[A]
Fa's having lots
and lots of fun![A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that what's fun?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
Fa was never allowed
to play outside before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Never...?
You always stayed indoors?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]La la la laa...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Always inside...[A]
She never knew the blessing of the
sky or the warmth of the Earth...[A]
[0340]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]Sue![A]
[OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can Fa ride on your horse
some time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My horse?
Of course, you can ride her now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not now.
Roy told Fa not to bug the others![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
There's a place Fa wants to go
on the horse![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A place with lots of pretty flowers![A]
Or a place where the sun's shining
and it's all nice and warm![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...All right.
We'll go sometime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yay!
Thank you, Sue![A]
[0341]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106]
[OpenMidLeft]Sue![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa wants to go to lots
of other places, too![A]
Fa wants to learn more
about the big outside world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Once this war is over, we can
go to many different places.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
There are many things in this world
that have been nurtured by the Sky's[A]
blessings and the Earth's warmth.
We can go see all those things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmmm...[A]
Fa doesn't get it.
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand when you get a
little older.[A]
I know you will.[A]
[0342]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]La la laaa la...[A]
Oh...[A][Clear]
A flower![A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][ToggleSmile]So that is a Dragon...
Mankind's archenemy...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But something's...
strange...[A]
The Dragons in the old scrolls
weren't like that at all.[A]
They were much more...
inhuman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-Me?
...I am Niime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Niime?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right...[A]
Oh, I must be off.
I had things to do.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[0343]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124]
[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Granny Niime![A]
[OpenMidRight]Granny, eh...[A]
You're actually several hundred
years older than I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, no matter.[A]
Fa,
take a look at this gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived on this land.[A]
The demons used their immense power
to destroy the humans.[A]
The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...[A]
And then one day...[A]
Eight bright columns of light were
born that would defeat the demons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were they pretty lights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...The humans used the lights to
fight against the demons.[A]
After a long and devastating battle...
the demons were finally defeated.[A]
But that wasn't the end...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Mmm... ... ...[A]
Fa's all sleepy now...[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]So...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]This is the enemy of mankind, eh?[A]
She doesn't seem to have a worry
in the world...[A]
...How cute...[A]
[0344]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]Granny Niime![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, hello, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...[A]
I told you the story of men
and demons the other day, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah!
The pretty lights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To tell you the truth...
I was afraid of those demons.[A]
After I studied dark magic and
mankind's history...only then[A]
did I discover just how powerful
and terrifying the demons were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
After meeting you, my fear seems to
have just gone right out the window.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's nothing.[A]
Well, my long stories must be
boring you.[A]
Here.[A]
Go play with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What a fool I was...[A]
I was willing to do terrible things
to an innocent little girl for the[A]
peace and safety of our race...[A]
What was I thinking...[A]
There's no point in peace obtained
[ToggleSmile]through such hideous measures.[A]
[0345]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]?
...Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!
Ummm...[A]
What's that thing there?
It's making pretty noises.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is a harp.
Do you like how it sounds?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah!
Fa really likes it![A]
And...What's your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Elphin,
my cute little lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Elf...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elphin![A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa likes you too, Elphin![A]
Your hair blows in the wind, and it's like
gold when the sun's all shining on it![A]
Fa likes pretty things like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it is an honor.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can Fa come and see you again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.
Any time.[A]
[0346]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Elphin![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, the cute little lady from the
other day.[A]
Hello.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa's name's not 'cute little lady'![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, pardon me.
Then...may I call you Miss Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa's name's not 'Missfa'!
It's Fa![A]
[OpenMidRight]As you wish, Fa.
Fa...the name has a unique feel to it.[A]
Is it your real name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Fa's real name is verrrrrry long.[A]
But they say it's a sound humans
can't hear.[A]
Fa's the only part that you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But maybe you could hear it, Elphin![A]
You make so many pretty sounds,
maybe you could hear Fa's real name![A]
[OpenMidRight]Shall we try some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah![A]
[0347]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Elphin?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, what is it, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa always wanted
to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?
I hope I can give you an answer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ummmm...
[ToggleSmile]Are you a girl or a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Which do you think?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa thought you were a girl
at first cause you're so pretty[A]
and you smell real nice![A]
But then Roy said the other day
that you were a man...[A]
So that makes you a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am a boy.
...Were you disappointed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope!
...Sooo, you're a boy...[A]
Heehee...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Fa's gonna get as pretty
as you when she grows up.[A]
So wait till then, kay?
Promise![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Fa! Wait![A][......]
[ToggleSmile]...I seriously doubt that I will still
be alive by the time she grows up...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose I should let it go for now.[A]
[0348]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shin...[A]
I'm sorry I put you through
such a difficult task.[A]
I must thank you for
finding my granddaughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was nothing, Chief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It must not have been an easy journey.
Where did you go after you left us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]After we lost the battle,
I set out looking for Lady Sue.[A]
I traversed through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.[A]
That is where I found her.
It was several months[A]
after you gave me the order.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
It has been a long time
since we lost that battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chief...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We lost many of our clansmen.
...Young ones, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you have survived, Chief.[A]
No matter how separated the clan is
you can bring us back together.[A]

[0349]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The nations in the west,
such as Lycia and Etruria,[A]
were very different from Sacae.[A]
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would not allow arrows to pass.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I would imagine.[A]
In the vast plains of Sacae,
horses are crucial.[A]
However, in more crowded areas,
key points are defended by soldiers[A]
such as the ones you speak of.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Betrayal and trickery are but
mere tactics to them.[A]
It is only us who think that
such methods are dirty.[A]
It is no surprise we lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But...[A]
I cannot agree with such
...dirty fighting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must accept the fact that
people use it, though.[A]
We must be prepared for it when it
is used on us.[A]
[034A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our Father the Sky has not only
brought us misfortune.[A]
Some good things happened
after we lost.[A]
Especially for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The land isn't as it used to be.[A]
We of Sacae must think with broader
perspectives outside of the clans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Chief...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have learned much
during your travels.[A]
I'm already too old to change my way
of thinking.[A]
But you are still young.[A]
It is your responsibility to lead
Sacae to a brighter future.[A]
This is an order from your Chief, Shin.[A]
It is up to you youths to decide Sacae's
fate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[034B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Sue, please step back.[A]
It's not wise to linger around the front.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shin, this is a battlefield.
I have to go up front to fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will do the fighting.[A]
You must think of your safety.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My archery skills have gotten much
better than before.[A]
I'm sure I can be of help to the army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have orders from the Silver Wolf
to keep you safe.[A]
I will not allow you to put yourself
in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.
I will do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sound like Grandpa
when you argue with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
The Silver Wolf is whom I respect
the most.[A]
[034C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Sue, you're still staying up
front, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand your concern, but I can't
be sitting around doing nothing, either.[A]
I can't stand simply watching the others
fight while I hide in safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I do understand how you feel.[A]
But Lady Sue, please don't
push yourself over the limit.[A]
You are the clan's last hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then that is more the reason
I should go up front and fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That depends on the place and time.[A]
Not everyone will follow somebody just
because he is fighting in the front lines.[A]
Lady Sue, we have a goal.[A]
We must gather our people and reconstruct
the Kutolah clan.[A]
Please do not forget that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't want you to push yourself
over the limit to protect me, either.[A]
I am not the only one working to
reconstruct the clan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.
I shall remember that, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you.
Do you promise not to stress yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[034D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is the matter, Lady Sue?
You don't look well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I heard you were ambushed...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not hurt, my Lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Shin, I want you to retreat to the
back lines.[A]
I will take over for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying, Lady Sue?
It should be the other way around![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've made up my mind.
You're going to step back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retreat to the back lines, Shin!
This is an order.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Everyone...
They were all killed by Bern...[A]
I couldn't even track down the traitor
in our ranks, and...they were all killed,[A]
right in front of my eyes...[A]
I was helpless, Shin.[A]
I don't want that feeling again.
I don't want to lose you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Sue...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must not die before I do.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was ordered to protect you, Lady Sue.
There is no way I would leave you and die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you promise?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.[A]
[034E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You're...
Shin, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You joined this army, too?
What a coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
It is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Um...oh.[A]
Did you find the woman you
were looking for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I-I'm sorry...
Maybe I shouldn't have asked...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
That's not it.
I was able to meet her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you did?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
It is.[A]
[034F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Shin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I hadn't asked you yet.
Which clan are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you from the Bulgar clan?[A]
Or are you part of the Djute
clan that betrayed us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
Was that...
a joke?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No, it wasn't.[A]
I lived with my parents so I don't
really know much about the clans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, you're from the Kutolah clan, right?
You said so before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
Our chief is the Silver Wolf,
the strongest warrior in Sacae.[A]
No one can match his mastery of
the sword and bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You admire him greatly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can you tell?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can tell by your eyes.
You're usually foreboding...[A]
I, I mean quiet...[A]
But you had a proud look on your
face just now.[A]
[0350]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...strange.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I am?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacaean women rarely pick up weapons.
Even if they do, they would choose a bow.[A]
You would rarely see a girl pick up a sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And...[A]
Sacaean people worship the
Sky and Earth.[A]
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...[A]
I have never seen a Sacaean like
you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.[A]
People can also live freely like you...
You've taught me a lesson.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think you're exaggerating...[A]
But it feels nice to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have beautiful eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of[A]
mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
Thank you![A]
[0351]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
......[A][Clear]
......[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleMouthMove]...Sigh...[A]
Why am I hiding here?
I want to talk to him, but...[A]
He's a little...forbidding.[A]
I'd like him to teach me how
to improve my bow skills.[A]
But how can I talk to him?
Well... maybe some other time...[A]
[0352]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]Hello, Shin!
My name is Dorothy.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...A little too intrusive?[A]
Would you like to have an archery
duel?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But I don't want to compete
with him.[A]
[ToggleSmile]What a nice bow!
Where did you buy it?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.[A]
Hmm... this is tough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, I know![A]
I can bring him some food that he
likes...[A]
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I like fruit, but what about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...[A]
[0353]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
...But why am I worrying so much
over him?[A]
...I can't figure that out, either.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I have to figure out a way to talk
to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, um...er...
[ToggleSmile]H-Hello![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, hello...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, wh...what...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What...what...kind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What food of kind you do like?
...... ...Shoot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind of food do I like, right?
I like fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...
...Did you hear me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[0354]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you doing, shooting at me!
I'm on your side![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh, right.
You were.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, right!?[A]
It's fatal for a Dragon Knight to get
shot with an arrow.[A]
Watch it, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]So, he's looking at me like an enemy.[A]
Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
considering what Bern did to Sacae.[A]
But we can't be quarreling among allies...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well...[ToggleMouthMove]
I guess I should do something about it.[A]
[0355]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Hey, Shin!
How are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fine, as you can see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're really great with your bow, huh?
You're hitting almost all of your targets.[A]
I'd like to as well, but I'm kinda...[......]

[OpenMidLeft]Look out![MoveLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenLeft]...Hm.
I missed his throat.[MoveMidLeft][A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought I killed him...
Sorry...[A]
I made you clean up after
my mistake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter.
You still saved my life.[A]
Hey, why don't you teach me some
tips on how to make my attacks[A]
more accurate?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]...Oh, well,
at least he helped me out...[A]
[0356]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][.....][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][ToggleSmile]Shin!
Behind you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you all right?[A]
I guess even you have some trouble
when you're surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll be going now.[A]
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't make that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did the other day![A]
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally[A]
make a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.[A]
...There's no way I would shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[0357]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sue?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I must apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because you couldn't get all
of our clansmen to escape?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]There was a traitor among us.
It couldn't be helped.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, it could.
I am the granddaughter of the Silver Wolf.[A]
I had to be able to lead our clansmen to
safety, no matter what the situation.[A]
But, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm the one who gave you those orders.
It is my responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you abandon your fellow
clansmen and flee all on your own?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Never![A]
When the enemy appeared, I rushed at them
to make time for our people to escape.[A]
But that was a decoy...[A]
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
You did your best.[A]
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...I'll try.[A]
[0358]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue,
are you feeling better now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I see you're still suffering over it.[A]
Well, I suppose you can't get over it
that easily...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I just let our people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sue, let's go out for a
long ride after this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A long ride?
In a time like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Especially in a time like this.[A]
You could get yourself killed fighting
with other things occupying your mind.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must listen more carefully to the
voice of the Sky and Earth.[A]
We humans are but tiny creatures compared
to the size of the great Sky and Earth.[A]
Haven't I always been telling you this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I am listening...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, you are only listening to your
own voice.[A]
We're leaving for a while after this
battle.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'll do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good girl.[A]
[0359]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]You look a lot better now,
Sue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I still can't forget that I couldn't rescue
our fellow clansmen, but I've decided not to[A]
dwell on the past.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll look forward towards the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it seems that you've learned
something from our ride the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was able to listen to a lot of
nature's voices for a change.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![A]
[ToggleSmile]I couldn't stand seeing you look
so distressed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had such a look on my face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others wouldn't know,
but I would.[A]
I'm your grandfather.
I've known you ever since you were born.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was only doing my duty...
as your grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
[035A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right,
where's the next enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]?
[ToggleSmile]Do you need something, Sue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You use a bow, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why don't you ride
on a horse?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Well...[A]
I've always fought like this,
on my feet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Isn't it hard to fight on the ground?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]
I mean, I think it would be harder
trying to shoot from horseback.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, Sue?
[ToggleSmile]...What was that all about?[A]
[035B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh hi, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still think it's better
on horseback.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
...Do you mean about fighting with a bow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and step back from your target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm sure it's up each his own...[A]
Wait, did you actually get off your
horse and try shooting from the ground?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't know unless I actually try.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But that's dangerous![A]
If you do something you're not used to
during battle, you'll get yourself killed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not in battle.[A]
I was just shooting at some trees
during our break.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you for being concerned
about me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're allies in the same army,
right?[A]
[035C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wolt?[A]
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Geez, it sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...[A]
I mean, remember how you said it was easier
to keep up with your target on horseback?[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You tried it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't know unless I actually try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How did you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you can't beat a horse's speed.[A]
Still, I think it's more stable on foot, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought it was dangerous to try something
you're not used to in battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
Well, I only tried it for a little bit.
So it's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to take advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Although, I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shoot very well?[A]
I probably wouldn't even be able to stay on!
Yeah...[A]
I think I should stay on the ground.
It seems to be more fit for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hehehe.
Perhaps you're right.[A]
[035D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110]
[OpenMidRight]Are you Dayan,
the Silver Wolf?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are not a Sacaean,
yet you know my name...[A]
Where did you hear about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once in the past,
I treated a wounded Sacaean.[A]
That is when I heard about the
unmatched warrior of Sacae.[A]
I was expecting someone with
white hair like mine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The name 'Silver Wolf'
comes from our ancestors.[A]
Our legends say that our
ancestors were wolves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you need something from me?[A]
If you wish to preach, I already
have a deity to worship.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No,
I did not come to preach.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Are you sure?
Do you not have to serve your god?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, my mission is to guide
those in need of direction.[A]
But you Sacaeans already have the
sky and earth to worship.[A]
God would not approve of me
pushing my beliefs on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[035E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We Sacaeans pray to the sky and the earth.[A]
The light of day and the darkness of night
that engulfs this land...[A]
They produce wind, lightning, fire, ice,
and many other affinities...[A]
Every person on this planet is protected
by one of the elements.[A]
According to my clan's beliefs, I am
protected by the Anima affinity.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see.
Interesting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Elimine Church has similar beliefs.[A]
When the creator made man, he blessed
them all with one of the seven affinities[A]
However...those elements...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Those elements hold no power
on their own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.
...Interesting, indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
Perhaps...[A]
This is one of the truths of
the creation of our world.[A]
[035F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The seven affinities...[A]
Their effects will only appear
through bonds with other people.[A]
When your heart is linked with
someone else's...[A]
That is when the elements reveal
their true power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Saint Elimine also said to cherish
your relationships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I wonder if we have been able to
link our hearts with each other.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am sure we have.[A]
We have yet to find out
what effects it has...[A]
[0360]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...[A]
What's that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
Have you not seen eastern bows before?
This is a bow we use for training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]C-Can I see?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, here.
Try pulling the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you're incredibly strong.[A]
A normal man wouldn't be able
to pull it at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I so strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now,
try shooting the arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]H-Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, you put an arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Put arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now let go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let go...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Argh.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales![A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Arrow hit me...[A]
[0361]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let me see your head.[A]
Yes...
It looks fine now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
No more bow for me.[A]
What's that horse?
Strange hair color.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it looks different from the horses
where you come from, doesn't it?[A]
We can survive in Sacae thanks to
these horses.[A]
We have no trouble keeping up with the
mounts that knights ride, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I want to ride...[A]
[Clear]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales![A]
Are you all right?[A]
Horses are very sensitive to people
standing behind them.[A]
You have to be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Ow...[A]
[0362]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Gonzales.[A]
It seems that whenever you are with
me, you get injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here,
I'll give you this as an apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.[A]
It would suit a fine warrior like
you nicely.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this as well.[A]
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I happy.[A]
I drink.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait,
don't...drink so much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
Uhhhhhhhh?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales!
Can you get up?[A]
This wine is very strong.[A]
You shouldn't drink so much of
it at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhhhhh...[A]
[0363]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're the Silver Wolf...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you are a warrior of Sacae, too.
What is your name?[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
..I was at Bulgar.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]Bulgar...[A]
So you survived.[A]
I heard that most of the clans
there were decimated...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]That time...[A]
I learned that it is the law of
nature that the weak die out.[A]
That is the same anywhere,
whether it be Sacae, or Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...
Is that the reason why you are here?[A]
To become strong and have your
you revenge on Bern...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0364]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
You said that you fight
for revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What will you do after
you have your revenge?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am asking you...[A]
After you avenge your clan,
what will you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You have no right to know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you dedicate your life...
to revenge?[A]
Is that all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You want me to just keep quiet, even
after seeing my entire clan killed?[A]
...But you have suffered the same.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is not what I am saying.[A]
We are men of Sacae.[A]
We must make those who desecrate
our land pay.[A]
However...even if we do win this
war and destroy Bern, those that[A]
we lost will still not return.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You cannot regain what you have
lost through revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know no other way to live.[A]
[0365]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
What will you do after this war is over?
Do you have a place to go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I thought.[A]
Then would you join the
Kutolah clan?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Our clan has lost,
but we haven't been destroyed.[A]
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once again.[A]
It would be helpful if you were
there with us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't take offers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not an offer.[A]
I am asking you because I have
faith in your strength as a warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hm...
Difficult person, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I shall say no more.[A]
But always remember that if you
ever change your mind, we will[A]
welcome you with open arms.[A]
Keep that in mind...
wherever you go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Yeah.[A]
[0366]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Barth.
I haven't thanked you yet, have I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanked me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You came to rescue me,
remember?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that.[A]
I was just fulfilling my duty
as a knight, my lady.[A]
In fact, I must apologize that we
couldn't get to you earlier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Barth...
I'm sorry.[A]
I can never give you anything
in return...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know.
Here, take this necklace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, please.[A]
We do not fight for reward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You were safe.[A]
That in itself is reward enough,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Barth...[A]
[0367]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Barth.[A]
Do you remember Devias and
Leygance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All I know is that they were making
contact with Bern to start a rebellion.[A]
However, the rumors that I have heard
about them are all bad.[A]
I understand that they were using their
position as generals to illegally collect[A]
money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The rebellion was being planned
even before Bern invaded.[A]
Ashtor has found proof of that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I was foolish.[A]
They were both my fathers' knights, so...
I didn't want to suspect them.[A]
I wanted to trust them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the trust is what
put you in danger...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know...
I'm truly sorry, Barth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina,
please value your safety above all.[A]
You are our master, and we knights
depend on you to pledge our loyalty.[A]
[0368]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barth...[A]
What do you think will happen
to Ostia now, without my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Unless someone rebuilds Ostia after this
war is done, it will fall further and[A]
further into chaos.[A]
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
I don't think I'm qualified.[A]
I'm just going to be a
nuisance to you all...[A]
You...think so too,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know not how a person in power
should be, but...[A][Clear]
When you said that you wanted to trust
your servants, I certainly did not[A]
feel that you were mistaken in
thinking so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I have one thing to say to you,
my lady.[A]
No matter what kind of path that
you would follow from now on,[A]
we knights will swear our
loyalty to always support you.[A]
[0369]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidLeft]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Barth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have you been keeping
up with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I've been wanting to asking you,
but why did you not try to become[A]
an Armor Knight?[A]
Why did you become a Mercenary?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I figured heavy armor wouldn't
suit me very well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is because you are not
training yourself hard enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, but I wasn't born with...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is the perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day from now on.[A]
Then you may be able to become an
Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
[036A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth...
This training is just...crazy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll get used to it soon enough.[A]
I do this everyday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't have the
build that you do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just keep quiet and
train yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[036B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
Is someone doing practice swings...?[A]
[ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Phew...[A]
I wonder if I've gotten any closer
to Sir Barth now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Woah!?[A]
Oh, Sir Barth!
You scared me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good,
very good.[A]
You see, your body has
gotten used to training itself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel like I just have to keep
moving my body.[A]
And besides, I would hate to lose someone
because I wasn't strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[A]
If you keep a habit of training yourself,
you will never get tired in battle.[A]
It doesn't matter whether you are an
Armor Knight or Mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
But I thought you wanted to
make me an Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just said that to make you train
as a habit.[A]
I know your build wouldn't be able
to handle heavy armor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It encouraged you more,
didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It did?
I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What did you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing...[A]
[036C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Ah, Barth.
It's been a long time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it has.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It seems that you have become
stronger since you left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They were tough battles indeed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I wasn't just sitting around
in Ostia, either.[A]
I was training myself at the arena,
preparing myself for when a battle[A]
breaks out.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That arena.[A]
Sorry for saying this, but...
I really don't approve of it.[A]
A knight, fighting to make money?
That's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one has a need for
a weak Armor Knight.[A]
I will keep training myself
to prevail in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
You haven't changed at all, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither have you.[A]
[036D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barth...
Was it all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did you not want to go into battle
alongside Lord Hector?[A]
After all, you were always saying that
a knight's true purpose is to go out[A]
and fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It would be a lie to say I didn't
feel that way.[A]
But I figured staying here and protecting
protecting this land and Lady Lilina[A]
would be a form of battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I allowed Lady Lilina into the
hands of the enemy.[A]
I was naive...[A]
Somewhere at the bottom of my
heart, I believed Ostia was at peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't blame yourself...
You need to fix that part of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I do...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, whenever I talk to you, it seems
that I reveal my inner feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We've been friends ever since we
we were knighted.[A]
Even if we try to hide something,
we could easily see through it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Haha...
Exactly.[A]
[036E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ask me what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why did you want to become an
Armor Knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because I wanted to protect those
I love with this armor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What about you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I became an Armor Knight because
they are strongest fighters.[A]
I believe that in a 1 on 1 battle, no
other unit can match the Armor Knight.[A]
...Which is probably why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina against a large horde...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That happened because I wasn't
strong enough.[A]
If I had enough power to stop the
rebellion all on my own,[A]
I would not have allowed the situation
to get out of hand.[A]
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Then you are to become a spear
stronger than any other.[A]
And I shall become a shield tougher
than any other.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A spear and a shield...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let us together make the way for the
lives that we shall lead in the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds good, friend![A]
[036F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight]Sir Barth!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I would never lose to such puny
enemies like these.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't ask you if you're safe,
either.[A]
We Ostian knights will never lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad that you're looking out for me,
but you should be concerned about yourself[A]
before worrying about others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[0370]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter, Wendy?
You're panting.[A]
An Ostian knight wouldn't be heaving
after a light battle like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember our training, Wendy![A]
Don't you remember how we marched
full-speed over the that mountain?[A]
This nothing compared to that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Show the enemy...
the wrath of the Ostian knights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
I will![A]
[0371]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth,
how can I improve my skills further?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're already a full-fledged
Ostian knight, Wendy.[A]
I don't have anything to
criticize you for.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you![A]
But...
Sir Barth...[A]
Can you...
say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
I'm sure there is something
I need to work on, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
From now on,
you must judge your own self.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I want you to teach me more...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't...
Don't leave me, Sir Barth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
What are you talking about?[A]
We are now comrades
fighting together.[A]
I wouldn't just leave you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
...We have wasted enough time
talking like this.[A]
Let's get moving, Wendy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![A]
[0372]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is no surprise, but Bern
seems to have been doing something[A]
behind the scenes even before the
war started.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
The traitors in the Alliance, the
rebellion at Ostia...[A]
It all happened according to their plans.
Well of course, I can't say much because[A]
I didn't realize when it mattered the
most...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The betrayals in the Alliance,
and Lord Hector's death...[A]
We are all to blame for that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nah, it's my fault.[A]
The mistake I made, it was just...
It was just way too big.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We must keep our eyes sharp so that such
a tragedy does not happen in the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I know.
Traitors and spies could be anywhere.[A]
Like in this army, for example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...![A]
There is a traitor in our ranks!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
Not that I know of.[A]
But you can never be too careful.[A]
I carved that concept into my
heart when Lord Hector was killed.[A]
[0373]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Asthor, about the other day...
About the traitor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have any suspects?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not yet.[A]
But I need all the information I can
get, so I'm doing some research in[A]
the shadows.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Traitors...
If you think of the possibilities...[A]
The list keeps getting longer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.[A]
I'll have to go through them
individually one by one...[A]
This'll be a tough job.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most obvious suspect
would be her...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.
Guinevere, Princess of Bern.[A]
You can't help but suspect her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy trusts her.
I really don't to think that she...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We would lose any trust our comrades
had for us when they find out we are[A]
suspecting them..[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
It's tough, ain't it?[A]
But someone's got to do it.[A]
[0374]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
...How did it go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
It took some time, but
I'm much more confident.[A]
The princess is innocent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere really
trusts General Roy.[A]
So does everyone else here.
Well, what do you know...[A]
This ragtag group's bond is
pretty strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I'm relieved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.
So that's taken care of.[A]
When we get someone new, I'll
be sure to keep an eye on him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry to have to give all
this dirty work to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.[A]
[0375]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
Has something been bothering you
lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh...
No, everything's fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
I have been given special orders by
Lord Hector to protect you at all costs.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So if something has happened, I should
know about it so I can protect you well..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I said, nothing's wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight]B-But you wouldn't be so...
touchy in your normal state...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Touchy!?
I'm not being touchy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just be quiet, Bors!
You're annoying me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Where are you going, my lady?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someplace where I won't
have to listen to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina![A]
[0376]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, uh...
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You were just being concerned for me,
and I just blew up at you like that...[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please...don't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Will you hear why I'm so irritated?
I think I need someone to talk to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If I would suffice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's about Roy...
What do you think about him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
I think he has grown splendidly well to
to be a wise and caring leader to us all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Roy I know would have
mismatched buttons on his suit,[A]
and he wouldn't be able to do
one dance step properly...[A]
So I always thought I had to
take care of him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]But Roy's suddenly changing.
He's gotten so...grown up, you know?[A]
He seems like such a faraway person
now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...My lady, Master Roy has not changed
as much as you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is true that he has grown and matured,
but that does not change the nature of[A]
the person.[A]
Master Roy's nature is still the same
as you know it to be, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's right...
Thank you for listening to me, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, my lady.[A]
[0377]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]You look much better today,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I feel much better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is good to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like Roy was avoiding me or
anything...[A]
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I was getting left behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was just jumping to conclusions
and fretting over nothing...[A]
Once I realized that, it suddenly
seemed so silly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm still a kid, aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, will you always stay
by my side from now on?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I am a knight,
and my loyalty is with you.[A]
I shall always be there for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors...[A]
[0378]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Oh!
Hello, Wendy.[A]
What a, uh, coincidence![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is good to see that you are well.
Did you need something, brother?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
I didn't.[A]
I was just walking around, and
I ran into you, yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you hurt?
Is your armor too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am fine, brother.
Well, I must be off...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're going already?
You could rest awhile longer...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you for your consideration,
but I really must be off.[A]
The battle is starting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes, of course...
Of course you should.[A]
[0379]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Wendy...
Just running in to you like this...[A]
Pure coincidence, yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something...
wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, no no, nothing.[A]
Well, since we've met again like this,
why don't we stop and talk a little?[A]
Well, are you hurt?[A]
Is your armor not too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
Thanks for your consideration.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you taking care of your
spear and your helmet well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you eating properly?[A]
Do you have any worries that you
want to talk about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Have you made a lot of friends?
Any boyfriends...[A]
[037A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa, W-Wendy!
We certainly meet a lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, brother.
Did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.
Just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am really grateful for your
consideration all the time.[A]
But I am a knight of Ostia.[A]
I'm training myself so I can
become like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I want to become strong, I can't
be depending on you all the time.[A]
I'm going to be fine, really, so
please don't worry...[A]
I must be off.[A]
...I'm really grateful for you,
brother.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
...I see...[A]
She's grown so much.[A]
I suppose I was the one...
being childish...[A][Clear]
Wendy, I wish you luck.[A]
[037B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Yo, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor...
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, nothing's the matter.
I just wanted to say hi.[A]
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove]
This smell...[A]
Are you drinking?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yeah. I was bored so I
decided to have a little one...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bored?
We are in the middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, all I can do is open chests and
doors...[A]
I can't fight at all.[A]
Well, I'll leave the fighting to you
and be on my way...[A]
Sorry to bother you.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[037C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Bors.
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor...[A]
I think you should...refrain
a little from your drinking.[A]
There are others watching, and
you are setting a bad example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...
about Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I heard there was a traitor in
the Lycia Alliance...[A]
If I'd gotten off my lazy ass and
had been doing my job properly,[A]
that wouldn't have happened...
Lord Hector would never have lost...[A]
As...long as he had the right
information...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]It is not your
fault.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And, you know...
The rebellion.[A]
It was obvious that it was going
to break out...[A]
And still, I couldn't do anything...[A]
Heh, talk about being totally
worthless...[A]
You all must feel sorry for
Lord Hector...[A]
Having such a useless spy like me...[A]
Haha... ha...
[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...
I'm out of booze...[A]
[037D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eh...?
Oh, Bors.[A]
Come on,
have a drink with me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop blaming yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We lost Lord Hector.
The responsibility lies in all of us.[A]
But... Still...
We must not look back to the past.[A]
We must move forward.[A]
We have to make the dream that Lord
Hector couldn't fulfill come true.[A]
And we need you for that, Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You... why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you...defend a drunken,
useless wretch like me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is because you are
a knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A knight?
Who...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Although you have not
been officially knighted...[A]
You fought with your life to
defend Lord Hector.[A]
That is more than enough
to make you a loyal knight.[A]
At least, I would think so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Bo..rs... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor, let us walk the path...
[CloseSpeechFast]and fulfill the dream of our master.[A]
[037E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors?
You are Sir Bors, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Oujay of Ostia's Armor Knights.
I have heard of you from Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, from her...
So you are our newest member?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I'm pleased to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But... you don't seem fit to be
an Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I figured that would fill in the
parts that our squad is lacking in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see.
That's very noble of you.[A]
Not many can do the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[037F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I heard from Sir Barth, that you
have even beaten him once, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Just once, in a martial arts
tournament held in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What was the battle like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
To tell the truth, I actually don't
remember very well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
Was the battle with Sir Barth so
boring that you don't even remember?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not it.[A]
It was because I don't fight for the
sake of fighting.[A]
That time I was forced to participate, and I
wasn't interested in the tournament itself.[A]
So I've already forgotten most of what
happened in it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oujay, there must always be
a cause in battle.[A]
You must never fight for the
sake of fighting.[A]
[0380]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors, you said the other day that
there must always be a cause in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And for that cause, you must be willing
to go through any and all hardships.[A]
Do you have such a cause?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
Unfortunately, I don't.[A]
I became a mercenary to feed
my family.[A]
So I don't really have a cause...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've got one right there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Feeding your family is a great cause.[A]
And for that cause, you train yourself
and become stronger, stronger than[A]
anyone else.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]A cause is not just limited to
large scale things like defending[A]
your country or saving the world.[A]
All right?[A]
[0381]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD]
[OpenMidLeft]Hello, Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...
Please stay close to me.[A]
I shall protect you with my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Th-Thank you...[A]
That armor...
It's quite an accomplishment.[A]
Isn't it heavy for a girl?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, my lady.[A]
The weight of a knight's armor
is the symbol of his loyalty.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right...
But just don't strain yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you very much,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why did you become an Armor Knight?
Did you want to become like Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
My brother is the goal that I pursue.[A]
I wish to protect you like my
brother does, Lady Lilina.[A]
[0382]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidLeft]Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's chat a little.
Tell me about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I am an Armor Knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not things like that...[A]
For example, do you have a
man whom you fancy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A...man?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... don't really know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I always just focused on becoming
strong like my brother, so...[A]
I never really thought about
things like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's talk about something else then.[A]
We're both girls in the same army that
grew up in the same place.[A]
I want to know about you.[A]
[0383]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Odd?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are in a much higher position
than we are...[A]
But you still come right down to talk
to us with a smile on you face.[A]
It seems...odd.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?
I just want to be friends with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]F-Friends?[A]
I don't think that would be
possible, my lady..[A]
You are my master![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't make a difference.[A]
You're the only girl around my age
that grew up in the same area.[A]
Let's not worry about who's the
master or the servant...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina![A]
You are carrying Ostia's future
on your shoulders.[A]
You are different from us.[A]
You do understand, do you not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...So we can't be friends?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
But I am very grateful for
your consideration.[A]
Perhaps we cannot be friends,[A]
but would you allow me to go over
and chat with you once in awhile?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
...Thank you, Wendy.[A]
[0384]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]What are you doing,
Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm practicing my walking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Walking?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For an Armor Knight, it's tough
to get back up if you fall to[A]
the ground.[A]
You have to build strong legs to
make sure that you will never fall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The basics are everything, Oujay.[A]
[0385]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! Ha![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD]Oujay, are you doing practice
swings with your sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I can't be losing to you, so I thought
I'd retrain myself the basics also.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
But,
I won't lose to you either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose we've got a
little competition going, then.[A]
[0386]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]How are you doing, Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm doing well, of course.[A]
I can't be complaining if I want
to be a strong Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, me too.
If I want to be a powerful mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oujay, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been able to keep trying
because I'm competing with you.[A]
If I didn't have you with me, I
probably would have given up, sayingア[A]
'It wouldn't have been possible
for a girl anyway.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I feel the same way.[A]
I've been able to come this far
thanks to you.[A]
We're even.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
But I still won't allow myself
to lose to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll throw those words right
back at you, Wendy![A]
[0387]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Oh...[A]
You're Sir Bors' younger sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you doing back here?[A]
With your light gear,
you should be far ahead of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Sorry.[A]
Your legs and back don't really
work the way you want them to[A]
when you're my age...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Sir Asthor,
just how old are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoo, scary...[A]
You're even more serious than
your brother.[A]
And you're even built like him.[A]
What a shame for a girl of your
age to be so f-[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not fat!
This is my armor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]O-Okay, okay.
Just calm down...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A-Anyway...[A]
Try to learn from
my brother a little more.[A]
[0388]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Wendy.
How are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Sir Asthor...[A]
What are you doing relaxing
here like this...[A]
This is a battlefield![A]
Please be more serious![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, there is no point in
getting too fired up for nothing.[A]
Come on, let's take it easy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You won't get away today.[A]
I'll drag you away if I
have to![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woah...[A]
Hey,
wait a minute...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Asthor...[A]
That wound...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Don't worry about it.[A]
It's just an old scar.[A]
I can't do much with this
leg because of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]When...did you get that wound?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...
A long time ago.[A]
I kinda messed up when I snuck
into Bern's castle on a mission.[A]
I managed to get away, so I guess it's
a scar of honor, so to speak.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...[A]
I'm sorry!
I didn't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, so I told
you not to worry about it...[A]
[0389]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wendy.
Beautiful as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can't flatter me like that.
I understand about your leg.[A]
But!
I still have a lot to tell you![A]
First,
about your drinking habits...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh damn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, you're not getting away.[A]
You shall behave like a proper
Ostian knight from now on![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh...[A]
[038A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain...!
What is wrong!?[A]
Your eyes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That voice...
Is it Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you not see, your Highness?
I thought your eyes had recovered...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still temporarily go
blind sometimes...[A]
I will be fine once I rest
for a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I heard that the side effects
of the poison had blinded you for[A]
several months...[A]
Forgive me, my prince...[A]
If only I had been on my guard,
you would never have suffered this[A]
horrible fate...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I wonder how...
my father is doing.[A]
Is he still in the same state?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I regret to say that he
is, Your Highness.[A]
He does not know of your
safety yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]But I am sure the life will return to
him when you return to the palace in[A]
one piece, Prince Mildain.[A]
He will recover...
and so will our nation.[A]
[038B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My prince,[A]
the balance of power on this continent
has been changing drastically due[A]
to General Roy's tactics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...so it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It will not be long before this
army conquers the entire continent.[A]
I believe that would be the perfect time to
announce your succession to the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas...
about that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Prince Mildain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have hesitations about
returning to Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying!?[A]
Our people are all anxious
about your safety...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas.[A]
After I went to the Western Isles and
joined the rebels, I learned much.[A]
Too much, in fact.[A]
I witnessed innocent civilians being treated
like animals under corrupt Etrurian landlords.[A]
If I hadn't been caught up in the
assassination, I probably never would[A]
have known.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then that is all the more reason to use
that experience to fix those problems...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I promise I will return to
the palace.[A]
But...[A]
Right now, I want to be with
the people and watch over them.[A]
[038C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.[A]
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.[A]
You don't mind that just for
now, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]
Then I shall pledge my loyalty to you as
another human being, not as a general.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is ever so
hard to bend your ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My unbending will is my strength.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This war will end soon.[A]
General Roy is still young,
but he understands the people.[A]
He will lead not only Etruria, but the
whole continent to a Gilded Age of peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I should do something as well,
don't you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall accompany you
wherever you go.[A]
[038D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Geese.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey...
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to thank you for
what you've done.[A]
I understand that you safely
escorted Pr-[A]
...I mean, Elphin to the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah,
I did what I could.[A]
That bard was an interesting guy.[A]
The girl he was with was seasick
the whole time, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...
Geese, I must apologize.[A]
I've misjudged you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since the assassins were after Elphin,
I couldn't put him on a large scale ship.[A]
That would be the first place they would
look.[A]
So I had to ask you.[A]
But I can't say that I fully trusted you,
a pirate.[A]
However, you kept your word.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey...
No problem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have turned him over to the Coup
d'etat forces and gotten a hefty reward.[A]
Why did you choose to help him?[A]
It didn't make you any money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, saving people makes
you feel good afterwards.[A]
Piracy sure as hell doesn't.[A]
[038E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese,
I must give you some kind of reward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reward?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have been a great help
to our country.[A]
I can give you anything
you ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What're you talking about...
I already got my payment you promised me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
That is not a sufficient reward.[A]
You are a hero to the Etrurian people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hero?
That guy's just a bard, right?[A]
Well, I was surprised when he turned out
to be the liberator of the Western Isles...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...
I must tell you something...[A]
......
...Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry.
I cannot tell you yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Geez...
Make up your mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway...[A]
I hear that you have helped
the Western people as well.[A]
Both our king and prince
had wished them to be freed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Sorry, but I don't really give a damn about
politics or other nations' statures or[A]
anything like that.[A]
I just wanted to do something for
the village that helped me out.[A]
[038F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
You have done me a great favor.[A]
It would be dishonoring my
family's name if I didn't return it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man,
you knights are so hard-headed.[A]
I swear, if you found gold on the
street, you wouldn't dare pocket it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh....
Fine, let me think...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...All right, here's what I want.[A]
I want you and your king to
make your country a good one.[A]
Make it a nation that won't go
around causing stupid wars.[A]
And make it a nation where people can
travel and do business safely.[A]
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you don't
do that for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Geese...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You deserve much better
than being a pirate.[A]
I will promise to fulfill
your requests.[A]
I shall swear my life to them![A]
[0390]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me.[A]
Are you Lord Douglas
of Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you are the
Great General?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am but a simple soldier now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
I am Igrene,
guardian of Arcadia, in Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I fend off invaders in
the desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
And do you need something from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish for you to promise me never
to attack Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I cannot promise you that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?

[OpenMidLeft]We are knights...[A]
If the king orders an attack,
we must obey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you know it to be wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is part of being a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0391]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas,
about the other day...[A]
Can you promise as a nation
never to attack Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you have so much wealth...
Why can you not promise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Things can happen even
without the king's orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria is a huge country supported by
various families of nobility.[A]
Not all nobles are kind at heart.[A]
If such nobles take over the court,
there is nothing the king or I can do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what is there to gain
in a desert like Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not about gain...
They simply want to show their power.[A]
They do not feel their worth unless
they have someone to step on.[A]
I hear that the people in the West
suffered from similar power abuse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0392]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it,
Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I said this before,
but as an Etrurian General,[A]
I cannot promise you what you ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, I will do my best to
fulfill your request.[A]
I shall spread the word that among the
heroes who rescued the king were warriors[A]
from Nabata.[A]
I shall persuade the nobles never
to disturb your peace in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I shall remember those words.[A]
I suppose that is all I can ask of
you now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[A]
[0393]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidRight]Percival.[A]
We fight together again.[A]
Though it looks like this time
I am fighting in shame.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please, Lord Douglas.[A]
You only did your duty as an Etrurian
General.[A]
There is nothing to be ashamed about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We are honored to be able
fight by your side once again.[A]
I'm sure the other Etrurians among
us feel the same way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you...[A]
Your words are encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let us fight together
for the future of Etruria![A]
[0394]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival,
how do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I could be doing better.
How about you, Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am trying my best, but...[A]
It seems I am losing the strength
I used to have.[A]
I suppose I cannot beat my age.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nonsense.[A]
You are living up to the title of
the Great General, Lord Douglas.[A]
You still have a long ways to go yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is there something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No,
that's not the case...[A]
[0395]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival.[A]
It might be a bit early to say
this, but..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am thinking of retiring as the
Great General after this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
Then the highest position in the
Etrurian military would be empty![A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you...
to take my place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am still young, Lord Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are young?
Then what about our commander, Roy?[A]
He is much younger than you,
and he is leading all of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The youths will not grow if old
veterans keep hogging their positions.[A]
Percival, you are intelligent, strong
and a fine leader.[A]
Besides, once the prince returns, the
king will step down from the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Douglas![A]
Those in service must not talk about
the inheritance of the throne...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is all right.[A]
I have been serving the king
for decades now.[A]
I know him better than anybody.[A]
I am sure once he learns of the prince's
survival, he will give the throne to him[A]
without hesitation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.[A]
Etruria will be reborn again with
the help from you young ones.[A]
I will be counting on you, Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I shall swear my life to it.[A]
[0396]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why didn't you tell me?[A]
I knew you were alive, but I never
thought you were here with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Here I am, living in shame.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nonsense!
You are a great asset to us all.[A]
It is an honor to fight alongside
you once again.[A]
Let us show the continent the
power of the Etrurian Generals![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
It's not like you to be so confident,
Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My courage is coming from you.[A]
You've always been my goal,
and you still are.[A]
[0397]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The former Sorcery General wanted
you as his successor...[A]
But it looked like you had many
enemies at first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I won't deny that.[A]
Being a female general was enough
to turn people against me.[A]
I spent most of my earlier days
fighting against prejudice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To be honest, I was unsure
of your abilities at first, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
Every time you saidア[A]
'You're weak, you don't know
how to fight.'[A]
I would bury my nose in spell
books all night.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's just like you.[A]
Well, it's no wonder you were
holding a grudge against me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
I never held a grudge against you,
Lord Douglas.[A]
Do you remember that time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The day I enlisted, the other young
generals were teasing me about my gender.[A]
But you defended me, sayingア
'She's stronger than you all.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm afraid I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's all right.
I remember perfectly.[A]
[0398]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must thank you.[A]
You've helped out an old,
worthless soldier like me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
What are you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whenever I fight,
I can feel my age.[A]
Aged soldiers are of no use.
My time has ended.[A]
It is now up to you to lead
Etruria to a bright future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I've never heard you say something
so stupid, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]A bright future for Etruria?
You can talk about that after we win.[A]
Even if we do win this war, we have
much to worry about.[A]
We must rebuild our land and regain
other nations' trust.[A]
Etruria's future comes...
after all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you're going to put all that responsibility
on us, while you take it easy?[A]
I don't think so, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You really have grown
more confident.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is thanks to you.[A]
Now, if you feel defeated,
why don't you be of some use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...very well.[A]
I suppose I can't be outdone by
you amateurs yet.[A]
Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, Lord Douglas.[A]
[0399]

[OpenMidRight]Father!
[ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I mean, Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry, it is all right for people
here to know our relationship.[A]
We don't have many chances to speak in
private like this.[A]
Just call me your father, as you
always do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father...
You don't look well.[A]
Are you okay?
Do you feel sick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not sick.
I'm just a little tired.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can I help?[A]
I'll do anything for you, Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalum...
It's all right.[A]
I feel better now after
seeing your face.[A]
You can go now...
there's no need to worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father...[A]
[039A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I brought you my Special Stamina Lunch
to help you keep up your energy![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see.
Thank you very much, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee...
Well, eat up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What, right here?[A]
I don't think a military general should be
sitting down eating his lunch in the[A]
middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I'm sorry![A]
O-Of course...
You can't just start eating lunch here..[A]
I'll just be embarrassing you...
I'm...so stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, it is my cute little
daughter's homemade lunch.[A]
I suppose I shouldn't be putting
it off until it gets cold.[A]
I changed my mind, I'll eat it now.
...Mmm![A]
This looks good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-It's okay, Father!
Don't force yourself![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's really delicious!
Mmm...yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I can send you out to be married
any time without worries, eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Father![A]
[039B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Father!

[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Lalum?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've finally found a way to
really cheer you up![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum...
It's the feeling that counts.[A]
Your consideration is enough
encouragement.[A]
You don't have to stress yourself
out so much, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not stressing myself![A]
If you look sad,
then I feel down, too.[A]
But if you're laughing,
then I feel happy as well![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum...
You're a really good girl.[A]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, thank you.[A]
Thank you for picking me up off the street
and treating me like your own daughter.[A]
I...[A]
I actually like myself now,
after you adopted me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalum...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
Father, you're looking all
teary again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoops...
I must watch myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, now let me cheer you up

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have something I must
ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Something to ask of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, could you...[A]
Please, could you teach me
how to use a sword?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...[A]
May I ask why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can only use bows.[A]
An archer is done for if he gets
ambushed in close range.[A]
I wouldn't be able to protect
Master Roy if that happens...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true.[A]
There are certain things that
can be done only with a bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Besides, is there much point in learning
swordplay now, at your late age?[A]
Mediocre skill would do nothing
but hinder Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[A]
You are being a great help
to Master Roy already.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wonder...[A]
[039D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
I can tell by your face that you
still want me to teach you swordplay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just don't get it.[A]
Am I really being of that much
help to Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
What do you think of us as
Lord Eliwood's knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Eh...?
Well...[A]
You're all really strong,
and I look up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that's nice to hear.[A]
Still, there is one problem
with us being Eliwood's knights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of us are even
close to his age.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood's vassals...[A]
They were all old like me or far
younger than him.[A]
He had no one to joke around with, no
one to talk about his concerns with.[A]
He was always fighting on his own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Always on his own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't want Master Roy to suffer
the same fate.[A]
You and Master Roy are the same age,
and what's more, you are milk brothers.[A]
So I want you to stay by Master Roy's
side and give him moral support.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Moral support?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
Fighting well in battle is important,
but that is not all that is necessary[A]
to show your loyalty.[A]
Think about it.[A]
[039E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wolt.[A]
You don't look so troubled for
a change.[A]
Well, do you still want me to
teach you how to wield a sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, after hearing your words, I cast
away my hesitation.[A]
I will perfect my skills with my bow,
and I will train myself so that Roy[A]
can count on me without doubt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]
With that attitude, it looks like
I can let you take over for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
B-But if you leave now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Calm down, I didn't say right at
this minute.[A]
Still, it won't be that far away.[A]
Once I am gone, you must take care
of Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, that's not it...[A]
It's just that...
can I really do it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There now, see?
You have to fix your lack of confidence.[A]
You will worry Master Roy with an
attitude like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can do it.
Have confidence in yourself![A]

[OpenMidRight]Sir Alan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Phew...
Ah, Wolt.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're sweating so much...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, I'm fine.[A]
I was just doing some practice
swings with my sword.[A]
I'm still weak.[A]
I must train myself further.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
We're in the middle of a battle.[A]
Shouldn't you be saving your
energy for an emergency, Sir Alan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shh!
...An enemy![A]
Let's go, Wolt!
Don't lag behind![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Wha-?
Y-Yes, Sir Alan![A]

[OpenMidRight]Sir Alan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah...Wolt...[A]
Good to see you...again...[A]
[OpenMidRight]D-Do you really have
to go so far?[A]
You'll be done if you
go into battle like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know it's crazy...
But I have to do it.[A]
Don't you feel the size of this
continent as fight through it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We must become stronger,
even if we go over our limits.[A]
We are the ones who must become
stronger to protect Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right...
I've caught my breath.[A]
Let's go![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]He's amazing...[A]
I can't be losing, either![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Alan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you training as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
After watching, I couldn't just
sit around waiting.[A]
I have to become strong
to protect Master Roy as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
That's the spirit![A]
Become strong,
and surprise Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Sir Lance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...I get it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Uh...Sir Lance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
Sorry,
I was thinking some things over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Have I disturbed you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I have reached my conclusion.
It is all right now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you need something,
Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I want to learn by your side.[A]
Teach me to fight like you, so I can
become stronger and protect Master Roy![A]
[03A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Lance?
What are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
I was keeping a record of
this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A record?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
In one of my favorite books, there
is a quote from a famous general.[A]
It saysア[A]
'The most important thing in battle
is information.'[A]
Therefore, I've been keeping track
of who does what in which location,[A]
for both our allies and enemies.
It might be of use someday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In the battles ahead of us, one
mistake could lead us to our deaths.[A]
We must pay careful attention to every
aspect of battle under Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's time.[A]
I must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]He's amazing...
I can't be losing, either![A]
[03A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Sir Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt.
...Are you all right?[A]
Your eyes seem to be
rather red...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes!
I'm fine.[A]
I was just reading the book on
war tactics that you lent me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, good job.
Were you reading it all night?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right,
you might be interested in this next.[A]
It's by the same author, and he describes
his ideas in detail over the course of[A]
24 volumes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you read this, then you should be
able to master the basics fairly easily.[A]
After that, we can go into more advanced
details...Wolt?[A]
Are you listening?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Y...Yes!
Of course![A]
I'll do my best...[A]
[03A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh!
There you are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, hello, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where were you, Father Saul?[A]
You just go wandering off
without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not call it 'wandering off',
Dorothy.[A]
I was diligently doing my missionary
work at the villages on the way here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Were you really doing your job?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
However, while I was doing my job,
a young maiden was being harassed[A]
by a very rude man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You mean yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do I not have any trust at all?[A]
Anyway, I drove off the man and
rescued the maiden.[A]
I must admit, I acted exactly
like a holy man ought to behave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
You're not exactly very strong.[A]
How did you do it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I went to the man and clung to
him, crying,[A]
'I thought we loved each other,
and now you are rejecting me?'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The man fled with haste.[A]
However, the maiden was also
gone when I looked back.[A]
[03A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul!
I've heard the rumors![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Dorothy?[A]
Can I not have at least some
peace and quiet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can't fool me with that calm
attitude.[A]
I've heard what they say about you.[A]
You're trying to ask out every girl
in this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There is a misunderstanding.[A]
I was just trying to
tell them of God's love...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not this time![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've heard that excuse before.
Can't you think of something better?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Then please wait a minute
while I think of one.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the point
if you think of one now!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Dorothy,
why are you so upset?[A]
This happens all the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's the problem![A]
People would misjudge the Elimine
Church if they see you all the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am so insulted!
I am doing my job properly, Dorothy.[A]
Have you not noticed the sharp increase
in our female followers recently?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't you understand?
If you're just asking every girl out...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've had it![A]
You'll have a lot to listen to when
you come back to the church tonight.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
[03A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
I haven't heard a valid excuse
about the other day yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I am sorry...[A]
I am sorry that I...could not
understand your feelings...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see what you were trying
to say the other day.[A]
You wanted to sayア[A]
'If you're asking every girl out...
why don't you do the same to me?'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wha...!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, er, um...
Th-That was just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I am a servant of God...[A]
I must be equally caring to all women.
Please forgive me, Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...Um,
er... I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How did that sound, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I pondered a lot, but that was the
best excuse I could come up with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]V-Violence is not appropriate,
Dorothy.[ToggleMouthMove]
Our loving God surely would not
approve of someone pointing their[A]
bow at an ally...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't care![A]
You better get out of my sight
before I shoot you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...[A]
What are you so upset about?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's your fault![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[03A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][.....][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleSmile]Look out![A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x10C][MoveMidRight]I-I-I'm terribly sorry![A]
I was aiming for an enemy,
but the arrow flew over here...[A]
Oh, what am I going to do?
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm fine.
It didn't even touch me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, I...
I'm so sorry![A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need to apologize.[A]
Things like this often happen
on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even if I did get hit by your arrow,
it would partly my responsibility[A]
for not paying attention to
my surroundings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Never let your mind wander in battle.
That is a rule.[A]
So don't be too upset about it.[A]
All right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, I understand.[A]
I'm probably being more of a
nuisance sitting here mulling over it.[A]
I'll try harder next time![A]
[03A9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That last shot was just luck...[A]
I have to practice more.[A]
Perhaps I should aim[.....]
more like this...[A][Clear]
Oh!
General Percival![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A]
Training?
Very good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes, thank you![A]
I sometimes make mistakes like I did
last time, so I thought I should[A]
train myself more so I wouldn't
be a hindrance to everyone else...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Dorothy, I've been thinking.[A]
You should relax more
when you shoot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...?[A]
You were watching how I fight!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I always try to watch and
understand how my comrades fight.[A]
I was looking for the chance to
tell you this, but I can see that[A]
you tend to panic when you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yes, that's true.[A]
I tend to get scared in an actual
battle, and I get nervous and can't[A]
move like I would like to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Archers don't have to come out
front, they stay back and cover for us.[A]
You must tell yourself that there
is nothing to be afraid of.[A]
We will defend the front lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]! ...Yes! I will![A]
[03AA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]...Yes![A]
Yes, that was great![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Percival![A]
I'm trying to relax when I shoot,
as you said.[A]
I think...
I think I'm getting better at it![.....][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You originally seemed to have talent
with the bow.[A]
It was just a matter of getting your
confidence together, and now that you[A]
have, you'll be improving more and more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can relax if I think that the others
are defending the front lines...[A]
It seems that you can sometimes
feel safe even on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but that is the same for
us up front as well.[A]
We would not be able to charge in like we
do, if we didn't have adequate support[A]
from the back lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Am I being of use to
you too, General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you're helping me out a
great deal.[A]
I shall be looking forward to
your support in future battles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bishop Yodel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Dorothy.[A]
You do not look so well.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know why I can't
use the sacred healing staves?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to help injured people by using
the staves like Father Saul and you.[A]
I've been praying every day, and I don't
think I've done anything bad, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Your faith is an example to us all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I still can't help the injured...
I want to heal them, but I can't.[A]
Will I never have the power?
Am I not worthy to be God's servant?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that is not the case.[A]
Do you know the story of the owl,
and the eagle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I don't.[A]
Please tell it to me,
Bishop Yodel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a story of a time when Saint
Elimine still walked the Earth.[A]
One day during Saint Elimine's
journeys, an owl approached[A]
her from the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The owl asked herア[A]
'I wish to go to the land of God.
Would you show me the way?'[A]
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and repliedア[A]
'God's domain lies high above
the clouds.[A]
Your wings would not be strong
enough to take you there.'[A]
The owl was very disappointed,
and returned to the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Poor thing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A]
We shall continue the
story some other time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Some other time?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not remember the
teachings of Saint Elimine?[A]
You must not try to
understand things in a hurry.[A]
You must think over what you are
told and develop your own opinions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...right.[A]
Then please continue the story
another day, Bishop Yodel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, Dorothy.
I promise you that.[A]
[03AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...After parting with the owl, Saint
Elimine continued on her journey.[A]
The next day, an eagle swooped
down from the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The eagle asked herア[A]
'I wish to go to the land of God.
'Would you show me the way?'[A]
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and repliedア[A]
'God's domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.[A]
Your eyes would not be able
to guide you through the dark.[A]
The eagle was very disappointed,
and returned to the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, the sympathetic and kind
Saint Elimine could not ignore[A]
the two birds.[A]
She backtracked, and brought the
owl and eagle together.[A]
She then told themア
'Journey to the land of God together.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The two birds traveled to God's
land together.[A]
The eagle used his powerful wings to
carry the owl, and the owl used his[A]
great eyes to guide the eagle
through the night.[A]
Together, they were able to reach
God's domain.[A]
That is the end of the story.
Do you understand, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
Sort of.[A]
[03AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About that story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...[A]
[ToggleSmile]So I still don't get its point...[A]
I sort of have an idea of what it
might be about, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then you have an answer, Dorothy.[A]
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.[A]
Each person interprets the story
and comes up with his own answers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, good.[A]
Bishop Yodel,
I think I feel better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, what did Saint Elimine do
after that?[A]
Does the story continue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The journey of Saint Elimine is
a long one.[A]
The next day when Saint Elimine
was continuing on her travels...[A]
[03AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D]General Percival!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.
It is good to see you are well.[A]
It seems that you've gotten
quite used to your position now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Although, I'm still one of the least
experienced and weakest generals...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, from the way I see it, those
working under you are the luckier ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so too,
General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...How have you been doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think
about this army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Frankly, I fee more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.[A]
Perhaps it is because of General Roy..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you feel,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can't say that I feel
completely comfortable here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is probably because what I seek
from an army doesn't exist here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...
You can't get used to this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, it's a little different
from that.[A]
It is just that I am and will
always be an Etrurian knight.[A]
I am unable to bend my
standards so easily.[A]
[03AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...How do you feel about the
coup d'etat in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I still understand that Bern was
doing some things behind the scenes,[A]
but still...[A]
I never would have imagined that the
Etrurian Court would divide into two[A]
hostile sides.[A]
To tell the truth,
I'm still not over it.[A]
I...I never thought that there would
be so many people who give in to[A]
greed so easily...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.[A]
Thus, blinded by peace, we didn't
notice the men scheming.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once this war is over, I will return
and devote my life to rebuild Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, General Percival.[A]
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
I want you to seek a different path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once I return to Etruria, I
plan to dismiss all but those few whom[A]
I can put absolute trust in to
be loyal to the king and country.[A]
I will do anything to maintain
mutual trust among the king's servants.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Percival...
Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidLeft]! Klein...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please, relax a little.[A]
With your ability, you won't have
[ToggleSmile]to go to such extreme measures.[A]
I was holding this in because
we are at war, but...[A]
I'll say it now.[A]
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.[A]
The days when we were more relaxed,[A]
and sometimes even laughed it up
together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once this war ends,
let us return and celebrate the[A]
prosperity of the new Kingdom of
Etruria together...in laughter.[A]
[03B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight]General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.
I just saw you, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You know, I was thinking...[A]
Before the coup d'etat, we never
were working together in the same[A]
mission.[A]
But now, here we are, fighting
alongside each other, after we have[A]
both left the Etrurian military and
are under General Roy's command.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, yes...
Fate can work in strange ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Oh, on a different topic...[A]
Have your favorite foods
changed over the recent years?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
...No.
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's just that the cook was a[A]
little worried.[A]
He says that since you are
expressionless no matter what[A]
you eat, he never knows what
to give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressionless?
...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, very much so,
General Percival.[A]
Even when you have wine, your
expression stays the same no[A]
matter what you drink.[A]
If you stop making expressions,
you'll forget how to make them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressions are not things
that can be forgotten.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't be so sure about
that with you, General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well, well.
Getting fresh, are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Haha...I guess it looks
like I need not worry.[A]
[03B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D]
[OpenMidRight]Excuse me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you need something,
General Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck...
You don't recognize me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well well.[A]
I never would've thought that
you still remember me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
I recognized you at once![A]
You didn't seem to notice me,
so I decided to talk to you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]13 years...[A]
Little Master Klein is all grown
up, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can stop calling me
Little Master.[A]
I'm already 19 now.[A]
I've been working as a general
under the king himself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know.
You've become quite an individual.[A]
How are Lord Pent and his wife?[A]
[OpenMidRight]They're laid-back as usual.[A]
Regardless of the coup d'etat,
they still don't seem to[A]
be that concerned at all.[A]
I really envy them sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
You've become pretty impressive yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well,
we can talk another time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck!
But we just met...[A]
[03B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein!
Don't come out front that much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is still a safe position.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You bowmen should stay
in the back and cover for us.[A]
There's no need for you to come
out and put yourself in danger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck, I told you, I'm not a child
any more.[A]
Until now I've been leading a squad
and fighting in the front all the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry, but you're still
'Little Master Klein' in my eyes.[A]
If I let you get hurt,
I wouldn't know what[A]
to say to Lord Pent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If you're being so considerate, then
you should come back to our mansion.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Dieck, when this war ends, do you
want to return home with me?[A]
Father and Mother would certainly
appreciate it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Klein,
I appreciate your consideration.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you really care about
your household, then you'll stop chatting[A]
with a lowly mercenary like me.
It won't be good for your future.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!? What...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're only talking to me
like this because we're in a war.[A]
Got it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Klein, I told you not to
come talk to me this often.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wanted to tell you a story.[A]
I want you to listen because we're
in such turbulent times.[A]
...It was 15 years ago, at Aquleia's
best arena.[A]
A noble's child was attacked by one
of the lions that were used in the[A]
opening show.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]A young pitfighter was the one who
saved the child.[A]
Ordinarily, he was a skilled swordfighter
who could defeat men twice his size[A]
with ease.[A]
But this time he was up against a
lion, so he didn't come out unscathed.[A]
He was wounded all over his body, and
his face suffered four deep scars.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The noble hired the swordsman who
saved his child into his service.[A]
For several years, the young man
served as the family's pitfighter[A]
and spread his name at the arena.[A]
But one day, he suddenly bought
his freedom and left.
The child, who looked up to the
pitfighter as if he were his[A]
real brother thought that he
 was betrayed, and was saddened.[A]
...But now I understand.[A]
You were thinking the best for
our family..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...You were much too kind to
me, a simple servant.[A]
Lord Pent and his wife raised me
as if I were their real child,[A]
regardless of the complaints and
finger-pointing going on around them.[A]
...That's why I left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand how you feel.
But I don't agree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were always thinking
the best for us...[A]
But did you ever consider the fact
that we were concerned for you also?[A]
I don't want us to be in a relation
in which we ignore each other...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Looks like I was being selfish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
Then you'll be with us like a
family again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you win Little Master Klein.[A]
I'll be sure to show my face to[A]
Lord Pent whenever I get the chance.[A]
[03B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft]That was a rough battle, master.[A]
Would you care to soothe your
tired heart?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you're...[A]
You're the bard that is always
with General Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
My name is Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Elphin, might you be...
No...that's impossible.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Forgive me,
Please forget it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I look very much like[A]
someone you know...
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]! It...can't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here I am standing right in front
of you, telling you myself, yet you[A]
do not believe me.[A]
Did my servants lack trust in me,
Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain![A]
It is you!
Oh...![A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm so glad you're in
one piece, your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have
grown while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Etruria has changed greatly
during the year you were gone,[A]
your Highness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know.
I am sorry to put you through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I was stationed in the Western
Isles, so it didn't affect me too much.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But...you're really alive...[A]
I'm sure all of the Etrurian people
will welcome your return![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[03B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight]Pr-...
I mean, Master Elphin![A]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]...General Klein,
might you spare a moment?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]Yes?
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Master.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Have I...done something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Someone is coming.[A]
We shall continue this some
other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[03B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We can have some
privacy here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pr-...Master Elphin,
you wanted to speak with me?[A]
Is it about Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
It is about the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
Are you talking about the
'Master' thing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not think it is strange
for an Etrurian noble to call a[A]
simple bard a 'Master'?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...!
Yes, you're right![A]
Forgive me.[A]
I shall call you Sir
Elphin instead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
Just 'Elphin' will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That will not do![A]
Even if you are in disguise,
I cannot address my prince[A]
simply by name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]???[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
Do you remember how you used to often
come to the palace with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I've been going to the palace as
long as I remember.[A]
Since I had no siblings, I couldn't
help but think of how cute you were[A]
as a toddler.
And I was still young and foolish,[A]
so I told your fatherア 'Your son
hall now be my younger brother![A]
'He must live in the palace from
now on.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, the prince,
said that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I was a fool.[A]
Of course, your father didn't know
what to say.[A]
And then you spoke up.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And you said the same words.
'That will not do.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]'I'm going to be your knight,
so that will not do.'[A]
Those were your exact words.
You also saidア[A]
'Chose someone else for your
brother!'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I-I was so rude...
I, uh...Forgive me, your Highness..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do not worry about it.
I'm glad you haven't changed.[A]
...When I came back from the[Clear]
[ToggleSmile]brink of death, the world[A]
looked so different.[A]
I'm glad some things are still
the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[03B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Klein!
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to tell you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
When I hired you and your squad...[A]
I was hiring you as an Etrurian
General.[A]
[OpenMidRight]???[A]
Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So if I weren't an
Etrurian General,[A]
you would be free to do
as you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
That's what I told my squad
when we joined this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you don't seem to be taking
advantage of that freedom.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What are you trying to say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tate?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's about what you
said the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said that I wasn't
taking advantage of my freedom...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wasn't quite sure what you
meant, so I wanted to ask you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, since you're free to do what
you want, there's no need for you[A]
to stay here.[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[ToggleSmile]...Does that mean that
you don't need my help?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, that's not what I meant.
Tate, you're a mercenary.[A]
Staying with this army isn't
going to get you much money.[A]
So if you're just fighting
alongside us out of guilt[A]
or a feeling of responsibility,
I just wanted you to know that[A]
you shouldn't feel that way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right.[A]
Perhaps it is inconvenient to
stay with this low paying army.[A]
But I'm staying with you out of
my own will.[A]
Please don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, all right, then.
I'm sorry if I have been a bother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not at all.[A]
[03B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidLeft]Tate, when this war ends, I
could help you find an army[A]
that pays well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, even though you said that
you're fighting with us on your[A]
own will, my being here is still
one of the reasons you stayed.[A]
I just thought that I should
compensate by helping out with[A]
your future plans...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I can do that on my own.[A]
I appreciate your consideration,
but please do not worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Or is my being here a
hindrance to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No!
Not at all![A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why are you telling
me things like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What's the matter, Tate?
How come you're so upset..?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ever since this other day,
all you've been talking about is[A]
getting me out of this army...
Away from you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Well, I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I chose to stay by your side
because I love you![A]
But you...
You're so inconsiderate![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, well...
I'm sorry.[A]
It's just that...I didn't..
know you felt that way about me..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]So...[A]
You know, Tate, you're to
blame as well![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You keep calling me
'General Klein, General Kleinア'[A]
like you want to keep your
distance with me![A]
That's why you make me think
that you're simply tagging[A]
along out of responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]B-But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No 'General' from now on.
Just call me Klein, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.
Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
[ToggleSmile]Oh...Yes...Klein.[A]
[03BA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel...[A]
Do you need something from me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
I thought we might talk a bit.[A]
Are you properly performing your
missionary duties?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, Bishop Yodel.[A]
Due to my hard work, we are getting
more followers every day.[A]
Please, take a look at this list...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hm.[A]
It seems that there are an
overwhelmingly large number of[A]
ladies' names on this list.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, this,
you see...is that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
They must have understood my
pure intentions more than[A]
the gentlemen did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I see.
Very good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Saul, please do not forget
that your main purpose is your[A]
missionary work.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Can't beat him,
can I...[A]
[03BB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul, how is your mission
coming along?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah yes,
as I notified you in my letter,[A]
Master Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Has anything else happened
worth noting?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
I am sorry to put you through
all this, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, please don't be.[A]
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.
That is very noble of you.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
We have been getting complaints
from Master Merlinus that you are[A]
following Princess Guinevere
everywhere she goes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, Bishop Yodel,
that is my mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul, your mission was to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.[A]
And you mentioned it is now in
the hands of Master Roy, not[A]
Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yes,
you are right.[A]
But Bishop Yodel,
please consider this.[A]
I do not think that should be
following Master Roy everywhere just[A]
because he has the Emblem.[A]
That would surely go against
my ethics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Saul?[A]
[03BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean,
Bishop Yodel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I know Master Roy
well enough to trust him.[A]
The Fire Emblem will be safe
in his hands.[A]
What we were fearing surely
not happen now.[A]
Do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps you are right.[A]
..However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I understand what
you are saying, Bishop Yodel.[A]
Master Roy is certainly a
noble person.[A]
Still...[A]
I think this world is a bit too
ugly yet for Master Roy to handle.[A]
I think that I know that more than
the other priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I am still a youngster.
You may forget what I said.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
All right then.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
I recently found this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
This is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]'All wounds treated freely.
Special discounts for new members now.[A]
Sign up today!'[A]
This...treating God like some sort of
vulnerary.[A]
I certainly do not want to think
that someone serving God would[A]
write something like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Saul, would you like to listen
to my lecturing for a little while?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Bishop Yodel, I am certainly
not worthy of having the privilege[A]
of listening to your...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Would you like to listen?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, yes I would,
Bishop Yodel...[A]
[03BD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Oh, dear God...
To have met such a beautiful lady...[A]
Dear God, do you understand my
happiness at this moment?[A]
I am a witness to your work of
beauty standing in front of me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you are Saul,
are you not?[A]
Good day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Oh...Uh, yes, good day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, I was thinking some things
over, and didn't hear what you were[A]
saying.[A]
Would you please repeat what you
said to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Well...[A]
Anyway, General Cecilia, seeing that
we are both servants of God, might[A]
you be interested in having dinner
with me some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
I am not a servant of God.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are, my lady.
Everyone in this world is serving God.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
So can we make arrangements for dinner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I'll think about it.[A]
[03BE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ah,
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have had the privilege
of meeting you again...[A]
It must be your overwhelming
beauty, do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, yes I am.[A]
However, I am only trying to make
you feel comfortable around me...[A][Clear]
Ah, yes![A]
We must decide on a date for our
dinner meeting.[A]
Have you thought about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dinner?[A]
[OpenMidRight]T-This cannot be!
Have you forgotten?[A]
The other day, we met and we agreed
that there is no person in this[A]
world that does not serve God.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes..
I think I can recall vaguely...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Vaguely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then, I suppose it shall
have to be another day.[A]
But please do not forget
next time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I'll try not to.[A]
[03BF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ah!
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Very well, I shall invite you
to my manor when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall be looking forward to that![A]
It is not ever day that one invited
to a high-class Etrurian noble[A]
mansion.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be a[A]
little...difficult.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Difficult?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.[A]
However, once when I was still
a child, I invited a male friend of[A]
mine to our house.[A]
When he saw that, he just drew his
sword on my friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
Is that really a matter of
being difficult?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father lost his temper,
and so we tried to calm him down.[A]
However, it was not easy.[A]
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,[A]
and what was supposed to be a
dinner party became more like[A]
an arena.[A]
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.[A]
That will always be a day to
remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
But my father is still on the
good end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You see, my grandfather can be even
more difficult than my father...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, I just remembered![A]
I had some work left at the church
that I must attend to.[A]
I'm terribly sorry, but since it seems
that arranging a dinner meeting would[A]
be difficult, I shall be off now...[A]
Good day, General Cecilia![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?
Well I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[03C0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Oh, dear God...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That I am able to meet such a
beautiful woman...[A]
This day must surely be blessed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed!
..Ah, before that...[A]
I am Saul.
It would be an honor to know your name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Igrene.
So...what do you need?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, such a beautiful name,
as I imagined.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene...[A]
If I were to describe the pleasure
of hearing such an elegant name...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, there is no need
to describe it.[A]
Do you need something?[A]
Do you know of the Elimine Church,
Igrene?[A]
It is very popular among the nobility,
because when you pray deeply all of[A]
your dreams will come true immediately![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...is that what
you want..[A]
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in God...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, but you must.[A]
If you don't follow the Elimine
Church, you will be cursed![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Is that the kind of God
that you follow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no, I was just kidding around.[A]
How about if have dinner together
some evening, and I can teach you[A]
about God's love...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is truly a miracle that we
can meet again like this.[A]
God must have guided you
towards me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's nice.
Well then, I must be going...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, please wait![A]
It is a wonderful thing to believe,
Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
I used to believe in God as well.[A]
Although it is a different God
than yours.[A]
I think I was fairly serious about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
Why did you stop believing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Several years ago...
I stopped praying.[A]
It was after I lost a loved one
in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those who pray to God expect something
in return.[A]
But they will never receive anything,
and that causes people to hate God.[A]
I think that it would be a lot less
trouble to think that no being exists[A]
in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yes...
You are right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is it all right for a priest
like you to be saying that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is all right,
I am an open-minded person.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However,
Saint Elimine did say this:[A]
'God does not help us
because He believes in us.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Believes...in us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[03C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?[A]
Ah, so you finally decided give
in to the urge, and see me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is about what you said the
other day...[A]
You said that God does not help
us because He believes in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]This is what Saint Elimine said.[A]
God who created this world is all-
powerful.[A]
He can change people and the world.[A]
He can alter us humans so that we
so that we would not be fighting[A]
like this.[A]
However, is that really the right
way?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Humans that act according to God's
[Clear]will alone would be mindless puppets.[A]
God believes that we humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.[A]
God knows that we can overcome our
hardships to achieve harmony.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
I don't believe in God, but I respect
people who think as you do, Father Saul.[A]
I must be off now...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, it is my pleasure to be
able to help you.[A]
Now, we can go on to discuss our
dinner meeting.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Are you Father Saul?[A]
I am Ellen, a sister of the
Elimine Church in Bern.[A]
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dear God...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...Father Saul?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must be blessed to be able to
meet such a beautiful lady.[A]
And you are a follower of the
Elimine Church![A]
This must surely be fate.[A]
Please, let us meet this evening
and we shall discuss the love of[A]
God in great depth.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to.
Shall we set up a time now?[A]
Any time would work for me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are going to talk about
God's love, right?[A]
Why would I even think of
refusing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Satisfaction?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please, never mind.
But Ellen, are you sure?[A]
I am actually rather loose around
women and I may do something[A]
undesirable to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, that will not happen.
You are a priest.[A]
You will surely not do
something like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Er...[ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sorry.[A]
Perhaps some other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
I was looking forward to it..[A]
[03C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Why, hello, Ellen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good day, Father Saul.
It is good to see you safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You are so tense,
so uptight![A]
No, that will not do.
You must relax your muscles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]NL
[03C5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul...
Why did you not come that night?[A]
Everyone was looking forward very
much to your preaching..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, um...
My throat wasn't doing well that day.[A]
We can do that some other time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Father Saul, you really are a
noble person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Excuse me?
Noble?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Usually you appear to be a impious,
improper womanizer.[A]
Hardly someone I would call a priest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there
was a complicated reason to that.[A]
You were putting on a show to show
how free the Elimine Church is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[A]
I, uh...see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting like that would naturally
cause misunderstandings..[A]
Everyone thinks you're just a lazy
man chasing after women...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you purposely walk that path for
the benefit of the Church.[A]
I surely could not do the same.
I sincerely respect you, Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
Well anyways, remember to relax
once in awhile, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father Saul.[A]
[03C6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Lady Miledy,
are you not hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Ellen, I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, if you're going up front, then
please take these vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You seem to be more...
helpful than usual.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
By no means![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you have something to say,
then I'm willing to listen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess I can't force you...[A]
But since we are both serving
Princess Guinevere, I would[A]
appreciate it if you told me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah well, I suppose I'll
wait until you're ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
Lady Miledy...[A]
[03C7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Miledy!
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
You said that I was being more
helpful than usual...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A]
Are you ready to tell me
[ToggleSmile]what's on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Uh...[A]
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Apologize?
For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]When Princess Guinevere and I
decided to go meet the Lycian[A]
Alliance army, I didn't consult
you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I just wanted to apologize
about that...[A]
I knew you had the deepest
loyalty for Princess Guinevere,[A]
and still...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You just followed Princess Guinevere's
orders, like we are supposed to.[A]
You have nothing to feel bad about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ellen, you mustn't always mull over
the past like that if you want to[A]
move forward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[03C8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Ellen, you look a lot
better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I feel like I relieved myself
of a huge load after you were kind[A]
enough to listen to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I'm no good, am I...[A]
I am the cleric, I'm the one who
is supposed to listen to you and[A]
relieve your stress..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen, didn't I tell you before
that you mustn't mull over[A]
things like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm actually grateful that you
didn't tell me when you went[A]
off with the Princess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thankful...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
You protected Princess Guinevere
while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Miledy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's continue to work together to
help Princess Guinevere in the future.[A]
So no more feeling down over trivial
matters, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[03C9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ellen![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Zeiss!?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I knew I saw you in
this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will always be at
Princess Guinevere's side...[A]
Sir Zeiss, did you join to
help Lady Miledy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course that's part of it, but
the main reason I joined is to[A]
see the heart that Princess
Guinevere has for Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
So you will be helping us
as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, not entirely, but...
[ToggleSmile]Yeah, I guess you're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you!
You will be of great assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, well,
I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry,
I must be off...[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, see you.[A]
[03CA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ellen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There was a man over there with
an extremely menacing face...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
Where!?
Oh, him?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Ellen, that person is in
our army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh... I...
I was so rude![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you scream or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You're still scared of men?
Well, I guess I can't blame you.[A]
It was years before you would
speak to me normally like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
It's more like you.[A]
But could you stop
calling me sir?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Okay, okay,
don't stress over it...Well then, see you.[A]
Just tell me if
something happens.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03CB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Ellen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir...Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]These flowers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're the same as the ones you
were growing back in Bern, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ellen?
What's wrong?[A]
Wait, are these the wrong flowers?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you always...
so good to me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?
Ah, er, well...[A]
Well, we come from the same town,
and uh...I don't know, it's just[A]
that I can't...leave you alone,[A]
[ToggleSmile]you know?[A]
I want to stay by your side and[.....]
protect you...[A]
Is that not good?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm very glad...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I must stay at
Princess Guinevere's side...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
I'm also a knight of Bern, so
I'll protect the princess with[A]
[ToggleSmile]with all my strength.[A]
So let's defend the Princess,
and someday we can return to[A]
Bern together![OpenMidLeft]Yes[A]
Thank you Zeiss...
Thank you...[A]
[03CC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Sister![A]
I got the medicine and sheets
that you asked for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, could you leave
them there please?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Well then, I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you an assistant to the
transporter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm fighting as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
A child like you...
in battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I may be still a kid, but
I'm pretty handy with my magic,[A]
you know![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I wasn't doubting your ability...[A]
It's just that... children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm only two years younger than
Master Roy, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy... well, he has no choice.[A]
But that's not the case for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm no different.
I have a reason to fight, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks for being concerned about me.
But I'll be fine.[A]
Oh, I have to go!
I'm in the middle of an errand.[A]
See you later, sister![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[03CD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have a moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, the sister from the other
day![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Ellen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Lou.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're really fighting in the
battlefield...[A]
Are you all right?
Are you injured?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
I'm small, but I'm pretty fast.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lou...[A]
I'm still worried about sending such
a small child into battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I look so small?[A]
Well, if I look at it, it's just
as dangerous to send a lady like[A]
you into the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That... may be true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right![A]
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll protect you.[A]
You can count on me![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, Lou.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please don't do anything rash.[A]
[03CE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x121][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Miss Ellen![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lou?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I thought I saw an enemy near
you, so...[A]
Phew...[A][......]
[ToggleSmile]But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were looking out for me?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
I said I would protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have such a kind heart...[A]
I am sure God would look favorably
on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... When you smile like that,
you look like a saint![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A saint?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I was always worried because you
always seem to look a little sad.[A]
Well, I suppose it can't be helped
in a time like this...[A]
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lou, I feel better when I see you
smile as well.[A]
[03CF]
emlpb[LoadFace][0xE482]srWhat?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of[A]
mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
Thank you![A]
[03D0]
y it?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.[A]
Hmm... this is tough.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, I know![A]
I can bring him some food that he
likes...[A]
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I like fruit, but what about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...[A]
[03D1]

 tlr me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03D2]

lbertrouble
when you're surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll be going now.[A]
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't make that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did the other day![A]
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally[A]
make a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.[A]
...There's no way I would shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[03D3]
you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[03D4]
pe.[A]
But that was a decoy...[A]
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
You did your best.[A]
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...I'll try.[A]
[03D5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Hm...
So this is a wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...[A]
Bishop Yodel of the
Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, pleased to meet you,
Miss Miledy.[A]
She is so passive...[A]
I would have imagined wyverns
to be more ferocious creatures.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Trifinne will spread her wings and
bare her fangs at my commands.[A]
However, that is due to the
training by the Bern Army.[A]
...Perhaps she wishes not to
be fighting at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Trifinne and I trained together ever
since we were still little.[A]
We trained hard to become a proud
Dragon knight in the service of[A]
our country.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I...[A]
I don't regret leaving Bern
with Princess Guinevere.[A]
of Bern...[A]
It is painful to fight against
my former allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I'm trying hard to
get used to it.[A]
For Princess Guinevere...
and for my country.[A]
[03D6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong,
Miss Miledy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
It's just that my house is
in this area.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah...[A]
So you have family there?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, my grandfather and my parents.[A]
Both my father and his father would
tell us stories of how they defeated[A]
legions of enemies in their time.[A]
They were so elated when my brother
and I were knighted as Dragon[A]
Knights as well...[A]
I wonder what they're doing now...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Miss Miledy...[A]
Your path has been a difficult
one indeed.[A]
Forgive me, I can't do anything
for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I appreciate you listening to
me like this.[A]
Perhaps...[A]
I was looking for someone
to talk to.[A]
If I will suffice, I shall be more
than happy to hear your concerns.[A]
Don't forget, Miss Miledy...
You are not alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,
Bishop Yodel...[A]
[03D7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel, I must thank you
For helping me so I wouldn't[A]
feel so alienated in the army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
It is my pleasure.[A]
Trifinne...your master is a very
kind-hearted person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a lot of
stress, too.[A]
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...[A]
I've dragged her along with my
selfish motives...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that Bern's training
implements absolute loyalty in its[A]
troops.[A]
Both in their knights, and their
mounts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is the case, then why is
Trifinne following your orders[A]
and fighting against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am sure that there were other
Dragon Knights and even Bern's[A]
in the enemy ranks.[A]
If this wyvern is simply a
creature that would follow the[A]
army's commands, she would not
be here with you now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand?[A]
This wyvern thought on her own
and made up her own mind.[A]
She chose to be with you.[A]
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...She made up her own mind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are a blessed person,
Miss Miledy.[A]
You always have close friends
at your side.[A]
You don't need me to do
anything special.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
Thank you...[A]
[03D8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Chad!
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?
Something smells good...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Here you go.
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey,
baked tarts![A]
Where'd you get these?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The meal delivery man
gave me some extra ones.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Man, they look good...
I can really have them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes!
...Man, these are good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Haha![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, sorry.[A]
It's just that you always look
really happy when you're eating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
I think that's one of the
best things about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What the...[A]
I'm not gonna give you anything
even if you praise me.[A]
I-I'll be going now.
Thanks for the food![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about.[A]
[03D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh!
Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh, a new pair of shoes?
Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't steal it, all right?[A]
The other day I came across an
old lady who lost her key, so[A]
I helped her out.[A]
She gave me the shoes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then why don't you wear them?
She gave them to you, not me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
My shoes aren't as beat up as
yours, and besides, they're a[A]
little small for me, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But we're about the same height.[A]
If they're small for you, they
would be small on me, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]J-Just take them![A]
I'm older, so my feet are a
little bigger than yours![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
That's not right![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course it is!
End of story, okay?[A]
[ToggleSmile]You better wear those shoes,
got it?[A]
See you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Chad!
...Thanks.[A]
[03DA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chad![A]
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A]
No, I was just thinking that it's
been a long time since we joined[A]
this army.[A]
I wonder how the little ones are
doing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I wonder.
[ToggleSmile]I hope they're being good
listening to the Elimine[A]
priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder if they're waiting for
us to return...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sure they are.
We're family, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know...
I'm glad that you came with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Then does that mean you think
I'm strong enough?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I already knew that you were
strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How can I say this...[A]
You have a twin brother,
Ray, right?[A]
So I kinda felt that even
if we three were together,[A]
I would be sort of left out.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean![A]
I always thought of you as
family, just as much as Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know!
Now I know better.[A]
I was just creating a wall around
myself and was trapped inside.[A]
But now I think of you as my
real family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Okay, I'll forgive you.[A]
You're my older brother,
even if you're a...[A]
little...childish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!
Lugh, you![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha...[A]
[03DB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Chad.[A]
Who said you could come talk
to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dammit, I wouldn't if
I didn't need to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy...[A]
I mean Master Roy wants to
see us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like I care.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You idiot![A]
Don't say such things in a
loud voice![A]
That Merlinus guy'll be
after us again![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, are you afraid
of that old geezer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sure am.[A]
He and Master Roy are both
nobles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, so little Chad'll
go bowing down to power?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Laugh while you can.
But let me say this.[A]
If we go against nobility,
we can't complain no matter[A]
what happens to us.[A]
Master Roy doesn't seem like
that kind of person, but I[A]
don't know about the others.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I don't want to watch someone I know
get beat up right in front of me.[A]
You've got quite a mouth, but
if you don't want to get killed,[A]
use it somewhere else.[A]
...I'm going.
You better come, too.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03DC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're still stealing
and stuff, huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
I've got no choice, all right?
I can't use magic like you.[A]
All I can do for this army is pick
locks and go gather information...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, it's pretty good
if you can do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know the other day when we
had to go see that Roy person...[A]
He said that he appreciated the
work of us, who are close to his age.[A]
But you were constantly bowing down
and saying that you never did[A]
anything important.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're doing something only you
can do.[A]
Then why don't you be proud of
it?[A]
You look like an idiot, always
putting yourself down like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Uh, are you trying
to cheer me up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Don't be ridiculous![A]
There would be no reason in hell that
I would be trying to cheer you up![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I thought so.[A]
Good, you had me scared for
a sec there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Dammit!
I'm going![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey!
What's your problem?[A]
[03DD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't ignore me.
I have to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When this war is over,
what are you going to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll go pick up the little
ones first.[A]
Then I'll try and get some money
to rebuild the orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'll go with you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can help out until the
little kids settle down.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I thought so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're actually a good guy
deep down inside.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh always used to say that you
were kind.[A]
I used to think that he was trying
to defend you as his brother, but[A]
I guess not.[A]
He's your brother all right, and he
knows how you really are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're just as naive
as Lugh![A]
Say what you want!
I'm going![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha, there's no need to
get embarrassed...[A]
Hey! Wait!
Don't walk off for real![A]
[03DE]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got talent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, so who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't know me?
I'm Cath, a master thief![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Who?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Ignorant...
I'm your elder.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You should respect me,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
I brushed my stealing skills on my
own, and I will continue to do so[A]
from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no, you're not going to
get any further on your own.[A]
Oh well, I guess you can learn
under my training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait,
why would I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So, you're now my Servant You'll work for me from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why would I!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'd better watch
your mouth.[A]
Isn't this your bag?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey![A]
When did you...[A]
Give it back![A]
[03DF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Give me back my bag!
Now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
Calm down.
Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What are those scribbles?
Who is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Father...?[A]
...You're an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I wasn't good in my studies,
but when I drew pictures, Father[A]
praised me.[A]
He said I had clever fingers, and
that I could be an artist someday...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
I see...[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]......
......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Ah![A]
I don't like situations like this.
I want to live more optimistically.[A]
You should do the same, [OpenMidRight]What do you mean, 
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You.
You're my Servant [OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I never agreed to that![A]

[03E0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Servant How have you been doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been watching you.
You seem to have been improving.[A]
Well of course, you're not as
good as I am, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, whatever.[A]
I never became your servant,
all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
If not my servant, how about
[ToggleSmile]my partner?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Partner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.
We can be partners.[A]
The famous pair of thieves,
out to save the poor![A][Clear]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pair...[A]
...That in itself doesn't sound
too appealing.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Wait a minute![A]
It's the master thief giving you
this offer![A]
I said wait![A]
[03E1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you!
Are you Hugh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
What do you want, kid?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is it true that you're
a moneylender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And if it were?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to borrow 3000G
right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm sorry, kid.[A]
I only lend money to grown-ups
or the hottest chicks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh.[A]
All right then, I'll ask
someone else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey, hey,
wait just a minute.[A]
You're an impatient kid,
aren't you?[A]
You can't just give up so
easily like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you only lend money to
adults or cute girls, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you really insist,
I can make an exception.[A]
But the interest will be
twice the normal rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought it would be something
like that.[A]
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.
I'll give it back to you on the[A]
next payday.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three.
Here you go, 3000G.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.
See you later.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Remember, it's 4000 including the
interest![A]
[ToggleSmile]...How could I turn him down
after he looks at me like that?[A]
This is why I don't like kids...[A]
[03E2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yo!
Here's the money I owe you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4000.[A]
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I keep my promises.
That's natural as a human being.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well you know, it's not so natural
for some people.[A]
Kids sure are honest.
You sure you chose the right job?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop calling me kid.
My name is Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.[A]
Well then, Chad, why'd you
become a thief?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I have to steal to live.
I'm an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You always lived your life alone?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I lived in a small orphanage near
the border between Lycia and Bern.[A]
I grew up with other orphans.[A]
We were doing pretty well, Father
and the other kids and me...[A]
...If this war didn't break out,
I'd still be there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Father was a nice person, but he was
only able to maintain the orphanage[A]
through the help of the villagers.[A]
And then the war broke out, we
started running out of food and[A]
clothing.[A]
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.[A]
So the only way to get food was to
steal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you sent the 3000G to the
orphanage...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
...The orphanage isn't there anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]W-What about the children?
Were they killed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks to Father, we all survived.[A]
The little kids are waiting for me
under the protection of the Elimine[A]
Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I used the 3000G to buy a strong
sword.[A]
I'm going to use it to help end
this war quickly and go pick up[A]
the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So the kids are the family that
you want to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.
I have nothing else.[A]
You got a problem with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
Sorry I made fun of you.[A]
You're already grown up, Chad.[A]
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.[A]
[03E3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey!
Chad![A]
Have you been doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I suppose.
But not as well as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Man, are you always like that?[A]
Can't you say something like,[A]
[ToggleSmile]'Hey, Hugh!
What's up?'[A]
or something with a bright
smile on your face?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sick?
Aw, come on![A]
You know, you got me all worked
up after you told me that story.[A]
I really want to help out![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Mister, are you really a mage?[A]
You sure you're not some kind of
jester or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]M-Mister!?[A]
Wait a minute, you're calling this
superbly handsome young man, a mister!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're a mister from my view.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh![A]
You stabbed me in my sensitive
spot just now![A]
...Not Mister, Mister won't do![A]
You can call me anything, but
not Mister![A]
I have a really sensitive soul,
soul, you know![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... Hahahahahahahahaha![A]
Haha...hee...my...my stomach...!
Hahaha...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh man, that was funny.
You're pretty weird, aren't you?[A]
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
That's okay, right?[A]
Since you say you're not a Mister.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you can laugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, you've always got that
glare in your eye.[A]
Your eyebrows are always bunched
up like this, you know?[A]
And you've got a foul mouth,
you've got an attitude, and you[A]
don't even smile.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying all of
a sudden?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen so many kids who've lost
the ability to smile in this war.[A]
Grown-ups have a lot of issues, but
come on, kids have to be laughing.[A]
Although it seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose[A]
there's still hope for this world.[A]
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a[A]
while, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.[A]
Don't mess up, you got that?[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...[A]
[03E4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir.[A]
Please let me stay with you and
learn from the mastery of your[A]
sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Suit yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you!
...But...[A]
[ToggleSmile]It doesn't feel right that you
are staying here partnering[A]
with me.[A]
I'm still a novice, and you're
the strongest member of our army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]They don't know how
powerful you are![A]
Once they see the true strength
of the Sword Saint, then they'll...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your heart is wandering.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I respect you so much, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is pointless to marvel
over one's power.[A]
That is not the kind of
strength I seek.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, Uncle.[A]
[03E5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uncle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Fir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please, teach me
the way of the sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to know how
you gained your power.[A]
I want to master the sword
like you did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The way of the sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is not something that can
be taught, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A sword is simply a sword.
It is a weapon used to kill people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That...[A]
That's not true![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There's no strength in this
piece of metal.[A]
I have lived by the sword ever
since I was born, but my blade[A]
never gained any power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]True strength is not the
power of a weapon.[A]
It is something that cannot
cannot be seen.[A]
We all have it within us.
Even you, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-Me...?[A]
[03E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please tell me,
Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What is true strength...?
What is the way...?[A]
What...[A]
What must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fir.[A]
You were always looking at your
Mother's back and following after her.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]And you've come to me for advice
because you lost sight of your mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But, Fir.[A]
You are not your mother,
nor are you me.[A]
The path which you seek
does not lie behind us.[A]
It lies in front of you.[A]
It is you who must cut open
that path for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In front...of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That isn't something that can
be taught.
It is something which you must
discover on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
Thank you, Uncle![A]
[03E7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...
I'm terribly sorry about my wife.[A]
If I could take her place, I
would do so in an instant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I can't exactly say that
my sister's health was in good[A]
condition.[A]
I'm glad she lived as long as
she did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One thing I am worried about
is Fir.[A]
She lost her mother at such
a young age...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Maybe...[A]
Maybe the reason she left home
to train herself was that she[A]
wanted to get her mind off of
her mother's death.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Training?[A]
So Fir was traveling around
the continent?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
She said she wanted to become
a great swordmaster like her[A]
mother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[03E8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bartre...
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Karel.[A]
...I was just thinking about
my wife.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About my sister?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I first met her when I was
traveling around the world,[A]
training myself.[A]
And then...
I met her at the arena.[A]
Her sword...it was almost
invisible.[A]
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand.[A]
In our family, the sword is everything.[A]
We are brought up by the sword, and it
is all we know.[A]
The sword was so central to our lives...
even to the point that it blinded us[A]
from our own human nature.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Each time I lost, I would challenge
her to a rematch.[A]
And then, the third time we fought,
I was able to evade her first strike.[A]
I was immediately knocked out by her
second strike, though...[A]
When I woke up...there she was.[A]
It was the first time I saw her
smile.[A]
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves alongside[A][Clear]
each other.[A]
Although...
I was never able to defeat her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You wouldn't see my sister
smile very often...[A]
She must have been that
fond of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?[A]
[03E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...After she fell sick, my wife
started telling me about her family[A]
for the first time.[A]
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you when she left this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Around that time was when we
first met each other as well...[A]
You resembled my wife when we
first met.[A]
You were inhumanly strong...
yet dangerous, and forbidding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
That time, I left you two without
saying a word.[A]
You must have thought what a
[ToggleSmile]terrible brother I was.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.NL
[03EA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You noticed me at this distance?
Impressive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Karel, the Sword Saint.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, what an honor.
You know me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Everyone who uses the sword
knows your name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I traveled all around
when I was young.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why are you in this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My family is here, so I joined
as well.[A]I'm hoping that even my rusty
skills can be of use.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rusty?
Even you joke around sometimes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am serious.[A]
I would probably lose out to
you young ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft]...Interesting.[A]
[03EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]You, please wait a moment.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am looking for someone to
spar with.[A]
Would you care to?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
Am I not a worthy opponent
for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your sword isn't used to kill...[A]
It doesn't agree with the path
I pursue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perhaps you think so now, but we
follow the way of the sword...[A]
All paths of the sword lead to
the same place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]...Do you need something,
Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sense no hate in your sword...[A]
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.[A]
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't cut through air...[A]
Your sword would beat them all.
I want to become stronger.[A]
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place, then would I be[A]
able to blend with the air
as you do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was born in Sacae as well.[A]
I grew up under the protection of
of our Father the Sky, and our[A]
Mother the Earth.[A]
They are all that are in my
sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not a pure Sacaean...[A]
I wouldn't be able to sense
them like you can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Was that true when you
were young?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were able to hear the sky
and earth once.[A]
Although it seems that your
hate is covering your ears.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course you will.[A]
The breeze that runs through
the plains...[A]
It never forgets those that
it loves.[A]
[03ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the Sword Saint...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...They gave me that name against
my will.[A]
Just call me Karel.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Karel, I am a Dragon
Knight of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...You're not going to say
anything?[A]
My father said you fought against
Bern in the past.[A]
He saw you in a rain of blood,
slicing all those who crossed[A]
through your path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I am through with this world.[A]
Bern, Etruria...[A]
They are meaningless words to
me now.[A]
I am only here for my family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
If only I could think like that...
But I can't...[A]
Not even after Bern has fallen...[A]
[03EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Before coming here...
I fought against my older brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]He's not my real brother...
His name was Gale.[A]
He was a Dragon Knight with equal
power to the Three Dragon Lords.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I always looked up to him.
My sister was also very fond of him...[A]
...I never would have thought the
three of us would end up as enemies.[A]
I never thought that we would have
to fight Gale...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]
Have I bored you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
A life story can never
be boring.[A]
[03EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why...[A]
Why did you tell me that
story?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...I thought that you would[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]be able to guide me...
Perhaps you would be able to help[A]
me get rid of my hesitation...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Unfortunately, I don't have any
words of guidance for you.[A]
But...
I can say this.[A]
It is you who must carve[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]your own path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Zeiss...[A]
I think you already
have an answer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.
Perhaps...[A]
I just wanted someone to tell
me that the path I chose wasn't[A]
a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I understand now.[A]
I chose to turn against my country...
And I won't regret that decision.[A]
[03F0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I've never heard of this
area before.[A]
I never knew there was a
place like this in Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]This is a land that people have
long forgotten.[A]
The years go by, but time just
seems to linger...[A]
It is that kind of place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you always live here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
Before I settled here, I used
to travel around the world,[A]
living by the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...
Have you been to Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Once, in the past.[A]
[03F1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]The Sword Saint...[A]
Have you heard of this
legendary figure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My mother used to tell me stories
about him.[A]
When I was still very young, a
large group of bandits attackedNL
[03F2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Master Karel...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I should tell you the
truth.[A]
Keeping silent to cover up one's
shame would be stepping off the[A]
path of the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shame?
You saved my village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
I never thought about saving the
Village.[A]
I just wanted to kill.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was like a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.[A]
I was aimlessly wandering around
looking for people to satisfy my[A]
lust for blood.[A]
As long as I could cut, as long
as I could kill, it didn't[A]
matter who it was.[A]
...Even if it were an infant in a
village I happened to stop by at.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...[A]
But it is a false name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]But...[A]
I can't imagine that what you
[ToggleSmile]say is true when I look at[A]
you now.[A]
You, standing before me now,
is the Sword Saint that I had[A]
always pictured in my mind.[A]
What...
What happened...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Some things you will realize only
after you have lost something else.[A]
However, by the time that my
foolishness had left me...[A]
It was already too late.[A]
[03F3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiir!
Where are you?[A]
Fiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiiiiir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]F-Father...
You are much too loud.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir!
It's good to see you safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's been a while since we
last met.[A]
I was getting worried that
we might not be able to see[A]
each other ever again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't exaggerate, Father...[A]
We were together during our
marches.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But we don't have many chances where
we can speak in private like this.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now come, Fir.[A]
You can tell your father anything
that's on your mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]F-Father...[A]
I'm sorry, but I have
instructions from Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you?
Then I shall accompany you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, but I must fulfill
my tasks on my own, otherwise it[A]
wouldn't be training.[A]
I must be off now.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hum...
Be careful, my daughter.[A]
[03F4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiiir![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiiiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Where are you, my daughter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]F-Father...[A]
You don't have to shout
so loudly...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been hearing some troubling
rumors, Fir.[A]
I hear that you are secretly seeing
this man in the army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it true, my daughter?
But fear not![A]
I shall crush any bad influences
that may advance upon you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No, you don't understand![A]
[OpenMidLeft]He's helping me with my training.
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, so you were looking for someone
to hone your skills with.[A]
But no worries, my daughter.
You have your father to spar with![A]
Now come,
charge at me with full force![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
I appreciate your consideration,
but it needs to be someone who[A]
can use a sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorryFather...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hum...[A]
Take care of yourself,
my daughter.[A]
[03F5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fi-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]I can hear you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Fir.
You were all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father!
Enough is enough![A]
I'll be quite fine on my own!
I don't need your overprotection![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Forgive me.
I was wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Forgive me, my daughter...[A]
I just wanted to make up for
our lost time together.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lost...time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
When you were still a little girl,
both your mother and I were always[A]
training.[A]
I regret now that we didn't pay
enough attention to you.[A]
You never knew your parents'
warmth and protection...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you grew up to be a strong,
confident young woman.[A]
However, that isn't thanks to me.[A]
So I just wanted to be able to
help you anyway I could...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father...
You were always kind and loving.[A]
Whenever I was about to fall
apart, you held me in your[A]
strong arms and comforted me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Father...
I was happy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fir...
Oh, my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]F-Father![A]
Please don't cry in a place
like this![A]
[03F6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah,
I have something to ask of you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want you to
spar with me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
For your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I must experience all sorts
of swordplay to master the art.[A]
You taught me about fighting at
the Arena that time, and...[A]
I would truly appreciate it if
You would train me for a while.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you say so.
It's fine with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Thank you![A]
Let's start now, then...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Wha-!?[MoveMidRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Are you okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes!
I'm sorry![A]
I'll get away now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not like you to
trip like that.[A]
Are you hurt?
Let me see your knee...[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No, I'm...f-fine!
We must get on with the duel![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you really okay?
You don't seem quite...well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-We fight![A]
[03F7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Are you okay?[A]
You should tell me if
you're not feeling well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You look like
you have a fever...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-It's nothing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...
Your face looks red.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's nothing![A]
It's just that I'm in a
little slump right now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir?
Is something on your mind?[A]
If you need someone to talk to,
I'd be happy to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah!
This might sound rude, but..[A]
D-Don't talk to me anymore![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft]......
...Fir.[A]
[03F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait, Fir!
Don't go.[A]
I need to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I...[A]
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.[A]
But...[A]
I find my mind wandering, and
I'm always thinking about you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir...[A]
[OpenMidRight]G-Goodbye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]Wha-...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you remember
the first time we met?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.[A]
But I couldn't muster up the guts
to do so.[A]
Even after we said goodbye to each
other, I've been regretting that I[A]
didn't tell you how I felt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I honestly thought it was a miracle
when we met on that island.[A]
And...[A]
Although I've been keeping it in
until now, I won't hesitate anymore.[A]
I have to tell you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir,
I...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]I love you.[A]
[03F9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Um.....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, excuse me,
are you Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering if you would spar
with me, if we get the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I've also been training my sword
skills, and I've won at many arenas[A]
around the continent.[A]
You don't have to go easy on me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I refuse.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Is it because I'm a woman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...When I swing my sword,
I do so to kill people.[A]
I have no interest in using
my sword for play.[A]
[OpenMidRight]! Play!?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]W-Wait...![A][Clear]
...He thought that I was playing
with my sword?[A]
I wanted to learn from him because
his blade is so sharp and he has[A]
no hesitation at all...[A]
[03FA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger!
We fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Get out of my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I will not move until you understand
that I am serious.[A]
Draw your sword![A]
I have been serious about training
my skills, and I will not allow you[A]
to say that it is simply for play.[A]
And I want to become stronger,
so I want to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I told you that I use
my sword to kill others.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
But my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I draw my blade here,
you will die.[A]
Is that your wish?[A]
[OpenMidRight]! ...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you have no intention of
killing me, either, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's why I say you're
just playing around.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...I just...[A]
...But maybe I was being rude,
I should apologize when I see[A]
him next.[A]
[03FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
Wait, please don't glare at
me like that...[A]
I'm not here to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]But your skills are indeed impressive.
I still see you as a goal to reach.[A]
I wish I could be as strong as you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Just be yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My blade is covered with blood.[A]
There is no need to see your goal
in that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Someone once told me...[A]
'All paths of the sword lead to
one place.'[A]
I still have yet to find out if
that is true or not, but I can[A]
say that your sword is definitely
on some kind of path.[A]
But I still have much to learn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Think what you will.[A]

[03FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see you haven't lost
your skill.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Rutger...[A]I keep telling you not to suddenly[A]
pop up and attack from behind![A]
Geez, I'd never have enough lives
if I had to put up with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
It is already decided that I am the
first one to land a blow on your back.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, obviously we were out to kill
each other when we were on different sides.[A]
But why the hell are you trying to slice
me in half when we're on the same side?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others bore me.[A]I need someone of your strength
to duel with.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So I'm gonna get killed because
you're bored.[A]
Wonderful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure...[A]
As if you've ever let my sword
touch you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you think!
I want to live too, you know![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll get you next time
for sure.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Geez...[A]
[03FD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Hey!
I thought I told you to stop that![A]
Persistent, aren't you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?
You seem to be in a bad mood.[A]
Did something happen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Lemme guess...[A]
You found a personal enemy in
Bern's ranks?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenMidRight]Guess I hit the spot.[A]
Then how come you're taking it
out on me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I saw the soldier who led the
attack on my hometown, Bulgar.[A]
But when I reached him...
he was already dead.[A]
It was you, Dieck.[A]
Those swords marks...it had
to be you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Sorry.[A]
Had I known, I would have left him
to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This is a battlefield.
Enemies don't belong to anybody.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...
Can't you relax a little more?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You can't rush through life...[A]
[03FE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm having trouble sleeping.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the leader of the Bulgar
attack you saw the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.
Well...maybe.[A]
Even after I see him dead, my
nightmares still persist.[A]
At that attack...
They left only me alive...[A]
The reason was because I...
didn't look like a Sacae native.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tough to kill someone with the
same colored skin.[A]
But you do have Sacaen blood in[A]
you, don't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
My father's mother and my mother's
father were Sacaean.[A]
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so there
are a lot of mixed people there.[A]
But usually the Sacaean side is
stronger in mixed children's[A]
in mixed children's appearances.[A]
But I...[A]
Only in me did the Bern side come
come out more, so I was kept alive...[A]
The people of Bulgar...they were
kind to me, even though I looked[A]
different...[A]
But they...they were killed,
so brutally![A]
I must destroy Bern...![A]
That one man isn't enough to
satisfy my revenge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought you had some kind of,
burden, but now I see it clearly...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I guess I'll go along
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have no need for sympathy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Come on, you know how strong I
am, right?[A]
If you really want to take on Bern,
there's no better ally than me.[A]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Suit yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And so I will.
Well then, let's go, partner![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dieck...
I'm sorry.[A]
[03FF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yo, Ward.
Come here for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Eh?
Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pay more attention to what's
going on around you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You could have nine lives, and it
still wouldn't be enough, the way[A]
you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Bro, I'm still alive.
With my strength, I can crush[A]
anything that crosses my path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The idiots who said that in the
past all got killed early on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry me so much.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Got it?
Good.[A]
You don't have to go all out
all the time.[A]
[0400]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bro!
Did you see me just now!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I took on 3 guys with one
swing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you even remember what I
told you before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?
Um...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Attack?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No![A]
I told you to pay more attention
to what's going on around you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Bro, fighting like that just
doesn't sit well with me.[A]
I'm getting stronger, too.[A]
I'll get strong enough so I can
crush anything that comes at me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...That kid can't sit still,
can he.[A]
[0401]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bro...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry, you win.[A]
The other day I almost got killed, and
then I remembered what you told me.[A]
Maybe I was getting carried away...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So after that, I've been
following your advice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that you have, 'cause
you're still alive.[A]
If you can pay attention to the
bigger picture, you won't get[A]
killed so easy.[A]
With your strength, you can
impress people without always[A]
rushing in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bro, you okay?
You're like, praising me.[A]
It feels...weird.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, shut up.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[0402]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bro, what do you think
about our employer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That kid, Roy?[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I like him.[A]
He's pretty impressive for one
so young.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, he is.[A]
But...
He's young.[A]
Too young.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I guess you're right,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand why you support him.[A]
He's a nice guy, and he's got
brains and guts.[A]
But...
The battles now are still easy.[A]
When he gets to a battle, in a
life or death situation...[A]
That's when we see how he really
is...[A] 
[0403]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Years ago...when I just became a
mercenary...[A]
I was only concerned about
spreading my fame...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really...
You had such times, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our squad was sent right in the
middle of the enemy lines.[A]
We were supposed to go deep into
Bern and kill the enemy leader.[A]
We waited underground for days...
and then the time came.[A]
And when we went out...dozens of
rained down on us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our employer...[A]
He purposely put us there so he
could buy time for himself to escape.[A]
Our squad was decimated.
They killed us all.[A]
All except for me.[A]
I was kept alive for torturing
purposes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We mercenaries are simply disposables
in their eyes.[A]
That's the norm.[A]
If you don't think like that, you won't
be able to take it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...that kid, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...he's different.
If I'd only known him before...[A]
[0404]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight]So...[A]
Looks like we're both still
alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Funny, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're mercenaries.[A]
We don't give a who wins, all
We care about are our money and[A]
our lives.[A]
We're best to just walk off
rather than stay and get killed.[A]
But...it's weird.[A]
We're going through all of these
incredibly tough battles, and I[A]
still don't feel like running
off.[A]
Roy...he makes me feel like I
can fight and die for his purpose[A]
and not have any regrets.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
I feel that way too.[A]
[0405]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Captain![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, please.
Not 'Captain'.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[A]
Back in Ilia, we always call
our leader the captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't suit me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, um...[A]
Okay, then I'll call you
Bro, like Lott and Ward do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, can't use that,
either?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just call me Dieck,
like you always have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
I feel left out when they call
Bro and I just call you Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey wait!
Dieck![A]
[0406]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Thany, I see you fighting on
your own a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
I'm on a pegasus, see?
I have a different movement pace
than the others, so it's easier[A]
to fight on my own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right then, I want you to
slow down your pace from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
But I'm doing fine on my own![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Everyone gets worried when you
just go charging in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But if I get stronger...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can you stand up against a legion
in the thousands?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, no.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then make sure you match your pace with
the others, to make sure we can win.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To make sure we can win, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wars aren't fought alone,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0407]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Dieck![A]
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
But you shouldn't trust them
too much, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
That's different than what you
were saying before![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What I said was a guideline for
fighting.[A]
What I'm saying now is a guideline
for a mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]For a mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A mercenary has to fend for himself.
No one's gonna be looking out for you.[A]
You've got to be skeptical.[A]
You should even be wary that I might
be giving out orders just so I can[A]
ensure my own safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not a problem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You wouldn't be thinking things
like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You never know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.
So do Lott and Ward.[A]
That's why we can entrust our
lives to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't get cocky, kid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee...[A]
[0408]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Oujay![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L-Lady Lilina![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't act so tense like that...[A]
I just wanted to talk to some people
from Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...all right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Talk to me.
Let's see...[A]
Tell me about your hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My hometown?[A]
Well...
It was just an ordinary village.[A]
We were poor...[A]The reason I came all the way
out to the city was to make money[A]
to feed my younger brothers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have brothers?
How nice.[A]
Do you have any sisters?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I have one sister who's a
little younger than me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
What's she like?[A]
Is she cute?
Does she look like you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I...I was still young, so I don't
really remember.[A]
But I remember holding her hand.[A]
Her hand...it was so small and
delicate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's so sweet...[A]
I've always wanted a younger
sister, too.[A]
[0409]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Oujay, how is your sister
doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Is she at home?[A]
Or did she come to Ostia with
you?[A]
If she did, I would like to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Lady Lilina,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me.
I'd love to meet her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]......
She's not around anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina...[A]
Our village was very poor.
...It is the men who become work hands.[A]
Girls...have no place.[A]
We don't have any extra bread, either,
so...[A]
When a girl is born in a poor family,
we put pretty clothes on her and[A]
leave her in a faraway town.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We were poor.[A]
I don't hold anything against
my family.[A]
If we hadn't done what we did...
we would have just starved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
I...didn't know anything...[A]
I didn't know anything...
and I...I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Don't cry!
Please, Lady Lilina...[A]
[040A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, about the other day...
I'm sorry.[A]
I said more than I should have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, I was so stupid.
But I don't want to stay ignorant.[A]
Right now I don't know anything
running a country, but I'll learn.[A]
I shall make Ostia a country in
which our children can always[A]
be happy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lady Lilina, please don't
strain yourself.[A]
My brothers are doing fine
thanks to the Ostian marquess.[A]
Even God can't save all
of the people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...[A]
My sister, wherever she is...[A]
She would have liked you very much.[A]
[040B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Hmm...
I need to work on my twirls more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!?[A]
Hey!
You saw my secret training![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
I didn't mean to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter![A]
I can't let you go back alive,
now that you've seen me.[A]
For an entertainer, being seen
practicing a trick means death![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D-Death?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, was that right?
Anyway, it's that embarrassing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
Well, I guess what's done is done.[A]
Hey, if you saw my dance, you might
as well tell me how it was![A]
What did you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uhm...
Well, it was really pretty.[A]
Although it was a little...
revealing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
You know, this dance's main part
is still to come.[A]
It becomes really amazing towards
the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow...it does?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][A]
Hey![A]
You were thinking naughty thoughts,
weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No no!
I wasn't![A]
[040C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]Hmm~~~[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Oh, you're that guy who was
who was spying on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That's a misunderstanding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you praised my dancing,
so I'll forgive you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You really like to dance,
huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess.
It's fun.[A]
I meet a lot of people when I
travel around, and they all[A]
love my dancing.
That sort of thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, I know.[A]
Do you want me to show you the rest
of the dance from the other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you want to see it?
You do, right?[A]
Then tell me that you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I... I want to see it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah well, I guess I can show it
to you.[A]
This is the sixth of the seven
dances I've mastered so far.[A]
And it's called...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's called...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dance Number 6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.
It's kind of...ordinary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were disappointed just now,
weren't you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No!
I wasn't.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you were.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I wasn't![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, sure![A]
Nope, changed my mind.
I won't show it to you![A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No...[A]
[040D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
Oh, I know.[A]
You just wanted to see that dance
so badly, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your dancing...[A]
I think I have seen it
somewhere before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
You have?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
A small band of entertainers once
stopped by my village when I was[A]
younger.[A]
I went to watch them...and a
little girl was dancing in the[A]
center.[A]
She tripped a few times and made
some mistakes, but she was trying[A]
really hard.[A]
I was going through some tough
times back then, but that girl's[A]
dancing kind of cheered me up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
I don't remember it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.[A]
You're probably cheering up
a lot of people with your[A]
dancing, where ever you go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Oujay.[A]
Tell you what.[A]
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Special...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's really amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow...it is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were thinking naughty
thoughts again, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
I wasn't![A]
[040E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Oh...
Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Damn...
So it's you, eh?[A]
I'm telling you, I'm not going
to be your friend or anything...[A]
...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You had an expensive-looking
bracelet on your wrist.[A]
Where'd it go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You have keen eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you hafta be alert when
you're doing banditry.[A]
Did you take it off or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I gave it away.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Gave it away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I met an old blind man on the
way here.[A]
He said that he would starve,
so I gave it to him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh man!
You princesses are so damn gullible![A]
He's obviously tricking you.[A]
He's making you pity him so that
you'll give him money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...
Maybe he's telling the truth...[A]
Listen kid, there's no way in hell
that he's telling the truth.[A]
After he gets his money, he'll be
laughing at you as you walk away.[A]
You're soft 'cause you don't
know the real world.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Well...[A]
I mean, it's your bracelet, so you
can do whatever you want with it...[A]

[040F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
I told you before, I ain't
your friend.[A]
There's no telling what'll happen
to you if you stay with me so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.
You're a good person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha!
Would you listen to that![A]
You really think you can tell
good from bad in the real world?[A]
Even after you were so easily
tricked the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm here for the money.[A]
And if I don't make any, I'll
just go back to being a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...In that case, why don't
you just attack me right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have magic tomes, ribbons...
a lot of expensive items.[A]
You can sell them all for money.
Right now, there's no one around...[A]
You should just take all my[A]
belongings and run off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...If you understand that much,
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]then why are you talking to me?[A]
What if I really did do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you did...then it would be my
foolishness.
But I don't think that you would
do something like that.[A]
I just feel that you're not a bad
person.[A]
I...trust you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Dammit![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]How could I do anything with her
looking at me like that...[A]
[0410]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
You said you gave your bracelet
to that blind guy, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What would you do if you met
him again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I guess I don't have to ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would get tricked just as
easily as you did before and[A]
do anything for him, I assume.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Why do you care so much for
total strangers?[A]
What are you gonna get from
helping them?[A]
You should just ignore them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...If I see someone in need, I
would feel that I want to do[A]
something to help him.[A]
If I met that old man again,
I would probably give him[A]
him something...again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Oh well, I guess some
people are just born stupid.[A][Clear]
Oh yeah...
I have to give you this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[ToggleSmile]?
What is this?[A]
It's beautiful...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dunno.[A]
Some old guy who said he'd met
you came up to me the other day.[A]
He asked me to give you this.[A]
He also said that he was really
grateful for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...
I met that old man way back in...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I don't know![A]
Anyway, he wanted me to give
this to you.[A]
Just take it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Garret...[A]
[0411]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey, you're a sailor,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Yeah, I am.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do sailors make a lot
of money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well, we used to.
But now...it's not so good.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I had to stoop down to piracy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Sorry to bother you, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
I thought you wanted something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking you might hire me
on your ship, but it's kinda[A]
stupid to go from a bandit to
being a pirate.[A]
I just...don't want to rob people
to live anymore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.[A]
It doesn't suit me anyway.[A]
I'm going back to being a trader
after the war ends.[A]
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.[A]
[0412]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Garret.[A]
Try spinning around in the spot
a few times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What kind of joke is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just think of it as a sailor's
test.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Damn.
Fine.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove].........[ToggleMouthMove]
All right, I did it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Now try walking straight over
here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[MoveRight][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Whoa.[MoveRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're gonna get seasick.[A]
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a seafarer.[A]
[OpenRight]What?
A grown man, seasick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't make a difference.[A]
Even grown men puke their guts
out when they're still not used[A]
to the rocking of the ship.[A]
And the outer seas can be nasty.[A]
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip the ship over.[A]
Well, I suppose you'll get[A]
used to it after a month or so.[A]
[OpenRight]A month?[A]
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
The oceans' huge.[A]
We sometimes won't see land
for an entire year.[A]
[OpenRight]Whoa...[A]
Maybe I don't want to do
this after all.[A]
[0413]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it.[A]
Sailing seems like a worse
option whenever I hear about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You think so?
The sea's a great place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you're always on the water,
right?[A]
It's just endlessly blue[A]
wherever you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's true.[A]
When the sun comes up in the east...
or when it sets in the west...[A]
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Dawn is great as well,
but I prefer the sunset.[A]
When you're sailing towards
the setting sun, it's just...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you can't make any
money with the sunset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You have no aesthetic sense.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All right, I'll let you on my
ship sometime.[A]
You can't call yourself a true
sailor until you see that beauty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't going to
make me any money...[A]
[0414]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eeeeeeek!
A bandit![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yup, I'm a bandit.
Got a problem?[A]
...Hey, I was wondering...
Do entertainers make a lot of money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't be doing banditry forever.[A]
I've been looking for a job that
would make me a decent amount[A]
of money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I don't know if we make a lot
of money, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, do you think there's
some kind of entertainment that[A]
I can do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
What I know best is dancing,
so...[A]
Perhaps there's one that
you could do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There is?
Teach me, please![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
All right.[A]
I'll teach you next time.
[CloseSpeechFast]See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm counting on you...[A]
[0415]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]No no!
You've got it all wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-What?
It was like this, right?[A]
You step like this, and
then you twirl...[A]
Am I doing something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just doing the moves isn't enough.
You have to have charm.[A]
With an expression like that,
everyone'll run screaming.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shut up![A]
This is the face I was
born with![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...?
Talking back, are we?[A]
Fine, then.[A]
I won't teach you anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...O-Okay...
Charm, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have to always be smiling.[A]
Come on, give it a try.
Let's see a smile...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Smile...
All right...[A]
......[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hahahahaha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What're you laughing at!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay, what more do you need...
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know.[A]
You don't look sexy enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sexy!?
Look, I'm a guy.[A]
Can't you imagine how creepy I'd
look if I tried to be sexy with[A]
this face?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...?
Talking back again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, all right!
I'll do it.[A]
I'll do anything you say!
Here...how's that?[A]
Do I look sexy enough now!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good!
You're doing well.[A]
Hahahahahaha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I swear, she's just
playing with me...[A]
[0416]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were just making fun of me,
weren't you![A]
You were teaching me how to
dance, huh?[A]
Well, that was nothing but a
load of crap![A]
When I danced in front of the
others, like you showed me, they[A]
all laughed their assess off![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Good![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What!?
Why you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look.[A]PNL
[0417]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You're a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Yeah, I am.[A]
You...Are you a thief?
Hey, do thieves...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shut up!
Don't come near me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I freaking hate bandits![A]
I feel like tearing my hair
out when I hear about them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, is that so?[A]
It's not like I care about what
you like or don't like, anyway.[A]
So you came to me just to say that?
You must have a lot of free time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...Huh.
What was that all about?[A]
[0418]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Damnit.
You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ugh, I saw a bandit.
My day is ruined now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh.[A]
Like you're any different.
You steal as well.[A]
You ain't got any right
to criticize me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha, I only steal from the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, so we're playing the
the good thief, are we?[A]
That doesn't justify...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha, maybe not.[A]
What I'm doing is theft,
I won't deny that.[A]
But...
I will say this.[A]
I'll never, ever do things like
burning villages down and hurting[A]
innocent people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Well...
Sorry.[A][ClearFace]
[0419]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You again?
Damnit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a bandit, like you say.[A]
I've plundered villages and killed
innocent people.[A]
But...let me say this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...I hate bandits as well...and
I hate the way I've been living[A]
like them.[A]
That's all.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.[A]
[041A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the hell!?
Are you an enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I, I...[A]
I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wasn't asking your name.
Well, I guess you ain't an enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How were you ever let into
this army?[A]
You're almost a complete opposite
of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I mean, look at what you're wearing!
You look like a total brigand.[A]
People'll be running away from you.
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well anyway,
you should learn from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Learn?[A]
You?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?
You got a problem with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No...[A]
Okay.
I learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not 'you'.[A]
I'm Master Garret.[A]
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]G...
G...?[A]
Strange name...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look at yours![A]
[041B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey.
You want something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
G...g...[A]
G...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Garret.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you that.
Here. I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Guess you aren't so useless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, my mom used to pick these in
the mountains when I was just a kid.[A]
The bittersweet seeds are the
best part![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Mom...
You have parents.[A]
I not have...[A]
I don't have any parents now, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]She was killed in a bandit attack
when I was just a kid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I survived.[A]
I found every single one of those
bandits and put them through what[A]
they did to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It took 8 years.[A][Clear]
But...now I have nothing.
I just... don't have anything else
to live for anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...
Why am I telling you this.[A]
[041C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
G...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Garret.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you that.
Here.[A]
I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa whoa...[A]
You didn't have to bring the whole
tree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well yeah, I do, but this
is going a little overboard...[A]
Ah well, who cares.
Thanks.[A]
You want some?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't eat.
I don't eat strange things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...And what's that supposed
to mean?[A]
Hm?[A]
...Looks like I better get going.
Come on, Gonzales.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[041D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You must be a Pegasus Knight
from Ilia.[A]
Pleased to meet you.
I am Alan, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Tate.
You know, do you always...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So this is a pegasus?
I've never seen one up close.[A]
It has a cute face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?
No, wait.[A]
What I was saying was, do you
always fight like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Is there something wrong with it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you think you're being
too rash?[A]
The way you fight, you never know
what'll happen to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, the way I fight can
be dangerous.[A]
But, you see...[A][Clear]
Oh, I shouldn't be chatting like
this during a battle, or I will[A]
give the enemy an advantage.[A]
I must get going.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...There's something wrong with you.[A]
[041E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have to tell you now.
Why do you fight like that?[A]
Even the way you thrust your spear...[A]
Why do you rely on brute strength
to attack?[A]
It makes it harder to evade a
retaliation that way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
I see you've been watching me
carefully.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
N-No...it's not that![A]
It's just that...[A]
How could someone miss when
you're fighting like that?[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, what I wanted to say was,
why don't you be more careful[A]
when you fight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand what you're saying.
But I can't pull back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're still saying that?
But the way you fight...[A]
[OpenMidRight]In battle, the first ones to match
blades with the enemy are us, the[A]
knights.[A]
The enemy will judge the entire
army's strength by looking at[A]
how we fight.[A]
That's why I have to show them
our power.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]If I cringe even a little, that
adds to the enemy's morale.[A]
If there is hesitation in my moment,
it will have a bad effect on the[A]
whole army...[A]
That's why I have to charge.[A]
I have to keep pushing forward,
for all of our sakes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
...I thought you were just an idiot
who couldn't do anything but charge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, but I have to fight
like this.[A]
Still, your advice was useful,
too.[A]
Give me some more when you get
the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...All right, I suppose.[A]
[041F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You haven't changed your
fighting, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long are you going to
continue fighting like that?[A]
I understand what you're saying...
But if you die, it's all over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that.[A]
There is only so much I can do
on my own.[A]
But I'm a knight, therefore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...
[ToggleSmile]Shall I stay at your side?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You would...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-If I leave someone like you alone,
I get worried and...can't concentrate![A]
So if I support you from nearby,
it'll be easier for you, too, right?[A]
Or... am I not good enough...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are![A]
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...[A]
With you around, it seems that
I can stay out of harm's way.[A]
I can trust you to guard my back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]O-Oh...[A]
But...
I'm really all right for you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course!
You're a strong warrior.[A]
You're perfect to fight
alongside with.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I meant...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So...the point is that...
I'm the one by your side...and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Nothing, forget it...
Well, come on, let's go.[A]
We have to hurry, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, let's be off![A]
[0420]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where's the next enemy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have been performing
well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, it also looks as if you are
charging into enemy lines without[A]
thinking.[A]
Your duty is to protect Master Roy.
Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
Defeating the enemy leads to
Master Roy's safety![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What if during your fighting,
Master Roy were to be hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That hasn't happened so far...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does that mean it won't happen
at all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...what must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take your time in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take my time...?[A]
[0421]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alan.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I need you to teach me something...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Teach?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said to take my time in battle.[A]
Then was my fighting style up until
now wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
But you only use the one style
of fighting you are used to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just one...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your courage is not a bad thing.
Rather, it should be praised.[A]
However, I am worried that you might
go berserk and go rushing in, leaving[A]
Master Roy behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A true knight must think about what
he must do at a given moment and[A]
change his style accordingly.[A]
Charging is not always the best way.[A]
[0422]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Alan, your fighting has
been impressive lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am trying my best to change my
fighting style, as you told me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Hm, you seem able enough to
take over after me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am old.[A]
I must make way for the young
generation, for Roy.[A]
I want you to take care of Roy
in my place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-Me...?[A]
Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course not!
It is an honor![A]
I shall protect Master Roy with my life
and bring further prosperity to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm down.
I told you that your fire worried me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need to get all worked up.
Master Roy is still young.[A]
You must grow with him, as a
knight, and as a person.[A]
[0423]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance!
How fares your sword today?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Neither good nor bad,
Alan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cool and calm as always,
I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The other day, I lagged behind
you, but not in this battle![A]
Watch and learn from my skill,
Lance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I'll watch you fight.[A]
Still, I have no intention of
losing to you from now on, either![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well well, what confidence![A]
I look forward to seeing you
after the battle.[A]
Well then, I'll be off.
You'd better come quickly too.[A]
[0424]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alan, the battles will only get
tougher from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
But it's just what I want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alan, I need to tell you something.
It's about when we lose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When we lose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.[A]
...If it looks like defeat would
be certain, you to take Master[A]
Roy and retreat.[A]
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy time for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
But then you would be in danger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone has to do it.[A]
Then it might as well be me, who
has been in Pherae the shortest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you're staying, then I will
as well.[A]
I won't allow you to go off alone
and commit suicide.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of a long line of
knights serving the Pherae family.[A]
So you should take Master Roy
and flee...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long you've served means nothing![A]
Then let me ask you this.[A]
Has your loyalty been less than the
other knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Can't say it yourself?
Then I'll answer for you.[A]
You're working just as hard as anybody![A]
You've been as loyal as any of the
other knights![A]
I know that best, because I've been your
partner ever since you came to Pherae![A]
[OpenMidRight]Alan...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't do anything stupid, Lance.[A]
You're a necessary person to both
us and to Master Roy.[A]
[0425]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Alan, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean about when we lose?[A]
Are you still saying that you're
going to sacrifice yourself,[A]
or something ludicrous like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I gave up that idea.[A]
...Your words were a slap in the face,
so to speak.[A]
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've been in Pherae the shortest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.
Except me, of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?
I really envy you sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course I have confidence.
How could I possibly lose to you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You'd better remember those words, for
you will be hearing them again from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha, never![A]
See you after the battle![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Even if we lose, you won't be the only one
staying behind and fighting to buy time![A]
You'd better remember that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
[0426]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're Ward, the mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Alan, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
You're one of our client's knights.[A]
Hey...
Are you a strong fighter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Talk about being sudden...[A]Well, I can say I consider myself
to be fairly skilled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, good.
You want to have a duel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.[A]
But I'm telling you now, I can't
go easy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would kill you if you do.[A]You'd better not be complaining
if you get hurt, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...let's go![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E]
[OpenMidLeft]W...Whoa...
You're better than I thought...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You too...
Good fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen up,
next time I'll beat you.[A]
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
Sure thing![A]
[0427]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight]Hey you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward!
How do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been looking for you.
Let's continue.[A]
We didn't finish the other day's
duel yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
I thought I won that match.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No way, I was just getting warmed up.
You haven't seen the real me yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh no?
[ToggleSmile]Then I shall go full force too![A]
[OpenMidRight]Bring it on![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E]
[OpenMidLeft]Damn...
You are strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're even now...
Lance and I used to spar like this a lot.[A]
It's a great thing to have a partner
you can train with to see how much[A]
you've grown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I haven't lost yet![A]
I'm really going all out next
time, you hear?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
I'll take you on any time![A]
[0428]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Aaaarrr![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...![A]
[ToggleSmile]You're...getting better, Ward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Y...You too![A]
You become stronger every time
I see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm still weak.
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heh, then I'll become stronger
than that![A]
No matter how many enemies come out,
I'll crush them all with my axe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Enemies...[A]
Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, how?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think we can win?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
Of course we'll win.[A]
I'm on this side, after all.[A]
How could we lose?
And we've also got you.[A]
No enemy would stand a chance
against the two of us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Haha...
That's right, I forgot.[A]
There's no way we could lose.[A]
It isn't like me at all to get
worried like that.[A]
All right!
Charge![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh yeah!
Let's go get 'em![A]
[0429]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Lance, have you gotten used to
the Pherae family yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Sir Marcus.[A]
Everyone has been very good
to me, who is an outsider...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
Good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have been very caring as
well, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must have you work
especially hard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Especially?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have something that the other
knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I do...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
And that will help Master Roy
in the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[042A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said before that I had something
that the other knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]However, I cannot see what that
something is.[A]
I am but an ordinary knight.[A]
I think you see more in me than
there actually is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I was in a different band of knights
up until recently, so I have no idea what[A]
I can do for Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There, you have it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have experience in other areas.
The others do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy will take Pherae's throne
in the future.[A]
And if only Pheraens are around him,
he will grow to be a person with[A]
limited views.[A]
We need someone like you who knows
knows other parts of the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Will my experience...
be of use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must make it so.[A]
Master Roy must grow to be an individual
with diverse beliefs.[A]
[042B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy was telling me the other day
that you were telling him stories of[A]
other parts of the continent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If my experience can be of use to Master
Roy, then I shall do my best to teach him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Well, it seems that I can now
Retire without any worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not if we have you.[A]
You can take my place once
I am gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?
But I am not a native of Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still worrying yourself over
matters like that?[A]
Master Roy certainly isn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...All right, then I shall take your
place when the time comes.[A]
But that is in the far future.[A]
You are still well, and you must
still be our example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe I can.
One never knows.[A]
[042C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are Lott, the mercenary.
An axe-fighter with much endurance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...You're Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seemed to have a troubled
look on your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
I was just thinking some things over.
Actually, this is perfect.[A]
Let me ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is something within my
meager knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, axes are weak against
swords.[A]
This is just common sense.[A]
What I'm wondering about is why
it became like that.[A]
I just don't get the evidence
or physics behind it.[A]
That's what I was thinking about.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Sometime earlier, I asked the same
exact question as you.[A]
I think I've found the answer after
I looked through several books on[A]
war strategy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So is it...
the weapon's weight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
Because all weapons are designed bearing
in mind that humans will be wielding them,[A]
it is almost inevitable that minor flaws
and weaknesses would not appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
It's impossible for a weapon
to just make you really strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
In the past, many kinds of weapons
were made, and disappeared.[A]
Among them, the sword, axe, and
spear remained, thus creating what[A]
is commonly known as the weapon
triangle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
But wait, what about weapons like
the Swordreaver?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that brings us to a
whole different dimension.[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidRight]..,Ah, I see...
Then what about...[A]
[042D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Knight to F6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Armor Knight to E3.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pegasus Knight to D1.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
Archer to B1.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Swordmaster to F1.[A]
Check.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You win.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think the mistake was when
I moved that ballista 6 turns ago?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]
Where did you learn how to play?[A]
I learned it as one of the
requirements of a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's an old war veteran living
where I come from.[A]
I couldn't find anyone to play in
the mercenary groups.[A]
But up against those who can play, it
looks like I don't stand a chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if you can point our your
mistakes, that shows you have skill.[A]
I played with Alan the other day,
but it was over in 2 turns.[A]
[042E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think we stand
a chance of winning?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I honestly don't know.
Well, we are outnumbered severely.[A]
The enemy can afford to send out new
troops all the time, while we have[A]
to be careful about losing even
one troop.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
Our starting conditions are just
so different.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Master Roy sometimes thinks of plans
that are beyond my petty thoughts.[A]
He has done miraculously well
in the battles so far.[A]
Under his direction, I feel like
we could never lose.[A]
Master Roy will surely lead
us to victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
... You're not the one to favor
somebody just because he's your master.[A]
So if you say so, it must be true.
Then I better start believing, too...[A]
[ToggleSmile]In our victory, and our leader.[A]
[042F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cecilia.[A]
Are your wounds all healed now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
I managed to survive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
...I'm sorry.[A]
I was there with you, but I
couldn't go to your aid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, you only did what
you were supposed to do.[A]
Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you for saying that...[A]
I plan on making up for it with
my work here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[0430]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,
Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That village we just passed...
It was ruined.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, it was.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably most areas of this continent
look like that due to the war.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We must put an end
to this conflict...[A]
So we can help those who
cannot defend themselves...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[0431]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia?
You look troubled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Percival...[A]
I was just wondering what will
become of Etruria after all this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just what you would think.[A]
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria will regain its former glory.[A]
It will become even more prosperous
than ever before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
We will make it happen with our
own hands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.[A]
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
You're right, Percival.[A]
[0432]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]Lord Percival, if I may have
a moment of your time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
Your Highness...!
Please do not address me as...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hush![A]
We do not know where enemies
may be hiding.[A]
Here, I am but a simple bard.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
...What is it that you need,
Elphin?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain of Etruria passed
away last year.[A]
I would appreciate if you could
inform me of the behavior of the[A]
Etrurian Courts.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Very well.[A]
After Prince Mildain passed away...[A]
[0433]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pr-...I mean, Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Lord Percival?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I hear your father is still alive.
Have you seen him recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, we have not seen each
other for several years now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you no intention of
seeing him at all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At least not until
this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
Perhaps your father is mourning for
you, thinking you are long dead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I let my father know of my safety,
other people will find out as well.[A]
I may be able to make my father
happy for a moment, but he will soon[A]
suffer the grief of losing me again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I must eliminate what is causing
that grief.[A]
Only then will I go see my father.[A]
[0434]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin.[A]
You were talking about your
songs for your future travels...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About the state of Etruria
after the prince passed away?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Will you be singing it in various
lands after the war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is what I intend to do.[A]
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course I will be.[A]
I expect my stay at Etruria to
be the longest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where will you go after you
visit the palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nowhere...[A]
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria for as long as[A]
I live.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do I have your word on that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I shall swear my honor on it.[A]
[0435]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're...
Lalam, if I recall correctly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look, look![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Watch me dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Well?
How was it?[A]
Did it grasp you?[A]
I think this twirl really does
the trick...[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
You always seem so carefree...[A]
Or rather, should I say...
disoriented?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Aww...
Are you praising me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0436]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]How is it this time,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Lalam.
I was wondering...[A]
Why do you always come to
show me your dancing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you enjoy seeing
me dance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To be perfectly honest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is of no worth to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove].........No worth...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...
You're so mean![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0437]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Odd...[A]
She was nothing more than a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, it seems...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]...Lonely?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Really?
Yes![A]
I knew you liked having me around![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't lie.[A]
You said it just seemed
lonely without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No,
I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew it![A]
Not even General Percival can live
without my dancing.[A]
All right, I'll come to you every
morning from now on and give you a[A]
wake-up dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.[A]
[0438]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight]Sophia, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Oh...
Igrene...Yes...[A]
I'm fine...
I'm just a little dizzy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't stress yourself if
you're not feeling well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
The outside world...
It's so big...[A]
I'm a little...excited...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you've never been
outside Arcadia.[A]
You can ask me anything...[A]
I know the outside world fairly well,
so I can explain things to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[0439]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...what is this?
I found it...on the ground...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let's see...[A]
Oh, this is a quarrel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Qua...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Quarrels are large arrows
used for ballistae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They can fire something...
so big....[A]
But...
It's strange...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Strange?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The outside people...[A]
They make such amazing weapons...and
they are much more advanced than us...[A]
But...why do they continue to fight?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]They're much...smarter than us, so...[A]
I thought they would know...that
war is pointless...[A]
...It is strange...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A][......]
you're right.
It is strange...[A]
[043A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
You seem to be in a good
mood, Sophia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I was speaking...to the other people
in the army...[A]
The outside people...
they are all kind...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...
That's nice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It would be nice...
if we could be friends...[A]
with the outside people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
But the elder told us not
to speak with outsiders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand what he's saying...[A]
The Dragons' powers could easily
destroy entire countries.[A]
If the outsiders found out,
they would surely fight over it.[A]
I've seen many conflicts like
that in my life...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But...someday...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
If we can live together with
Dragons, there should be no[A]
reason why the outsiders can't...[A]
[043B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...![A]
Is it...
Is it really you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoa, what the?
What's going on?[A]
I'm Astol.
Just a measly thief.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You look like him...[A]
You look so much like...
my husband...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your husband?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I lived with my husband in Arcadia.[A]
...That is, until he suddenly left
without saying a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh.
And he looks exactly like me?[A]
Well, they say that there are at
least 3 people on the continent[A]
with the same face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Let me see your leg.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey hey,
what're you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When I first met him, I found him
collapsed in the desert.[A]
The heat got to him, and he lost
memory of his past.[A]
He had blade wounds all over his body,
but he had a particularly bad injury[A]
on his leg.[A]
It never fully healed, and it left
left a scar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm not your man.[A]
My legs are clean, I don't have a scary
looking scar like that on either of them.[A]
Well, I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[043C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you...
Are you really not him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nope.
But hey, I can't believe this guy.[A]
He must be a real dastard to dump
such a beautiful woman like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Please, let me tell you
about him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]As I was treating his wounds,
we started living together.[A]
We lived happily for several years.[A]
Slowly, his memory started returning
started returning to him.[A]
I was happy about it, but I was
also...scared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.[A]
My husband left to fend them off,
and never came back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.[A]
I couldn't find my husband, so I
thought he had followed the same path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that must be what happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
I can't help thinking in the bottom of my
heart that he might be alive somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah. I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
If he were alive, he wouldn't just
disappear without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He probably wouldn't be leading such
a glamorous life anyway, even if he[A]
were alive.[A]
I say you forget about him and
move on.[A]
Hey, I know.[A]
Maybe I can give you a kiss
in place of that guy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow...[A]
Oh well...[A]
[043D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay, I suppose the rejected man
should slink away now...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Golrois...![A]
...I mean, Astol.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Please look at this...[A]
My husband was carrying it when
I first met him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are these scribbles?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're not scribbles.[A]
This is an emblem given to
Lycian spies.[A]
I also did some research on what
kind of work they do...[A]And...
I now understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information that is
incredibly dangerous to the enemy[A]
if it is leaked.[A]
If a spy gets caught, the enemy will
dig deep down into his weaknesses.[A]
Family members and lovers are taken
as hostages...[A]
And the spy is put through endless
torture until he spills every bit of[A]
information that he has.[A]
That's why spies have to be alone...[A]
They must not make family or friends,
or lovers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry to say this to you, but...
That guy is dead.[A]
He was devoured by the quicksand of
Nabata.[A]
All this stuff about spies and whatnot...
It's just your imagination.[A]
Or perhaps you saw an illusion in the
desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I...see...[A]
Then...
I must have been dreaming...[A]
I must have had a dream of
a short period of happiness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Igrene.
...No...[A][Clear]
Sorry, forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just...forget it all.
...Please.[A] 
[043E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The battle is growing bigger
all the time...[A]
Marcus, do you think Roy will
be okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, my lady.[A]
Master Roy has taken after Lord Eliwood,
who was said to be the greatest knight[A]
in Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Mr. Eliwood was a great knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lady.
And also...[A]
Lord Eliwood's wife, she was a very
kind and gentle person.[A]
Much like yourself, I might add.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...
Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy is becoming very much
like Lord Eliwood.[A]
The woman that Roy is seeking would
probably be similar to that which[A]
Lord Eliwood had found life with.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My lady, if I may suggest.[A]
When you and Master Roy return
to Pherae, then you two could...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus!
Roy and I are friends.[A]
Just friends!
Marriage...[A]
It's too soon to be thinking
of such things![A]
[043F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Marcus, what kind of couple
were Mr. Eliwood and his wife?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, my lady, when the two were
youths, that just looking at them[A]
would cheer one up.[A]
The people of Pherae were truly
happy for them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow...
That's nice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.
And one night...[A]
Before the two became engaged,
Lord Eliwood suddenly disappeared[A]
from the castle.[A]
When he returned to his live three
days later, he presented her with a[A]
beautiful white flower which only
grows in the snowy highlands.[A]
It was the flower which she
loved the most.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mr. Eliwood is so...romantic.[A]
Sigh...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Now look at Roy...[A]
[0440]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus...
What does...[A]
What does Roy think of me?
I...[A]
I'm not so sure anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, he's...[A]
I've always...liked him...
for a long time now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why not go up to him and
find out for yourself, my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not have much experience in matters
like this, but I have heard the maids[A]
at the castle saying that it is no
longer the age that women should be[A]
sitting around waiting.[A]
Lady Lilina, if you were to advance
on to him first, Master Roy would[A]
surely fall for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Yes.[A]
I'm the one who's known him
the longest.[A]
I can't lose to those
other girls![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina![A]
[0441]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if it isn't Lady Lilina.
You look as beautiful as ever.[A]
In fact, you're so beautiful you're
making my wrinkles fade away.[A]
See?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ashtor...you don't change, do you?[A]
My father was saying that you'd
be doing a lot better than you[A]
already are if you were more serious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, well, guess I can't
argue with that, m'lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Where did you first meet
my father?[A]
He never told me anything...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
It really ain't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was a measly thief back then.[A]
And so I decided to creep into[A]
Castle Ostia to swipe some
treasure, see?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well m'lady...[A]
...Whoops, I really shouldn't be[A]
wastin' precious time here like
this...[A]
Forgive me, m'lady, but I'll
continue the story some other time..[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
What a shame...[A]
[0442]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]...It was easy getting
to the treasure.[A]
I'm an expert at picking
locks and stuff.[A]
Anyway, after I'd grabbed all
the goodies and stepped outside[A]
the treasure chamber, bam!
There he was, standing[A]
right in front of me.[A]
And wouldn't you know,
that person was...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector just stood there,
staring at me.[A]
He didn't seem surprised
or anything. You could tell[A]
he was somebody just by looking
at him.[A]
Me? There I was, frozen in the spot,
carryin' bags of loot over[A]
both shoulders.[A]
Would he call the guards?[A]
Would he cut me down right then
and there?[A]
And I was wondering what
was coming up next...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He suddenly burst out
laughing, m'lady.[A]
He said, 'Quite a man to be able
to get through my castle's security[A]
so easily. What is your name?'
And I was just standing there,[A]
with my mouth hanging open.
Lord Hector then boomed, '[A]
Would you offer your skills
for the benefit of our country?'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought he was out
of his mind. But I knew he[A]
wasn't kidding around by looking
at his face.[A]
Anyway, I thought, to hell
with this, and I tried to[A]
bolt out the door with the treasure.[A]
And then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And then from behind me,
Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What did he do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Whoops, I'm sorry m'lady,[A]
[ToggleSmile]I really should get goin'.
I'll continue the story[A]
[OpenMidRight]Again?
Oh well...[A]
[0443]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
He didn't move an inch even when[A]
he saw I was making my escape.
So I ran.[A]
I was almost at the door, and Lord
Hector still stood there motionless.[A]
I didn't know what was going
on, and I turned around and[A]
yelled at him, 'I'm getting away!
You ain't gonna do anything!?'[A]
A heavy voice came back to me,
'Flee if you wish. You may keep[A]
the treasure as well.
But does that make you happy?[A]
Do you want to live your life
in the shadows in constant fear[A][Clear]
of being found? Is that really
what you want?'[A]
I ran like hell, m'lady. I fled
from the castle, from his voice.[A]
After that, I just walked around
the area aimlessly through the night.[A]
Dawn broke... and I found myself
in front of the castle.[A]
[Clear]
Lord Hector was standing there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Ever since then, I've been
working for him, m'lady.[A]
He changed me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So that's what happened...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina, I can say this
to anyone, at any time.[A]
Your father...
was truly an honorable man.[A]
[0444]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]So, who's next!
[ToggleSmile]...?[A]
Hey![A]
Thany![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be scurrying around
the front lines so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?
Scurrying around!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's annoying when some weakling who gets
shot down so easily by a puny archer is[A]
flying around all over the place![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah!?[A]
Well, it's a pain for me to have some
slow axefighter with no brains fighting[A]
near me as well![A]
Haven't you ever heard of the
concept of dodging?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What did you say!
You pickin' a fight with me!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're the one picking the fight![A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, even if we do fight, there's
no way that slow axe of yours is[A]
gonna reach me up here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey... Thany!
No fair![A]
Get down here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No way!
Catch me if you can, slowpoke![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Goddammit![A]
Why does she always have
to mess things up for me!?[A]
[0445]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Little early to be relaxing,
ain't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow![A]
Hey![A]
What did you do that for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There was an enemy archer
aiming at you from the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And here you are, taking it easy.
What an idiot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot?
Who's an idiot![A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone who just decides to relax during
a battle seems like an idiot to me.[A]
You're just lucky I happened to
pass by.[A]
If not, you would've been a goner
by now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
Hmph, I could easily have taken care
of a single archer.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You didn't have to put me in your
debt by saving me like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, is that so![A]
Well excuse me![A]
Fine then, I'll just be watching
From now on.[A]
Good luck![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]That idiot![A]
I couldn't thank him...[A]
[0446]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where did she go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Ward.[A]
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I told you to leave this part up
to me.[A]
That doesn't mean you just go flying
off on your own![A]
We have to listen to the leader's
orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if we sit around waiting for
orders, we could miss a big chance![A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you get it?![A]
What if you just dashed out on your
own into a bunch of enemy archers![A]
How come we always have to have people
like you who just don't think before[A]
they act...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
I thought you were angry about
me flying off on my own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![A]
We need to work as a team in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
T-That was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-W-What are you talking about![A]
N-N-No way![A]
I-I was just telling you how we
should act in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward, you're tripping over your words.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Gimme a break.[A]
That's not like you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you're right.[A]
[0447]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, who's next!
Bring it on![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ward, can't you calm down
a bit?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eh?
What's that?[A]
You scared, Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]As if![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well then, we're fine, right?[A]
I go charging in, and you cover up
the small parts for me.[A]
We've been doing great like that
all this time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mary asked me to take care
of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sis said that?[A]
Geez, I'm not a kid anymore..[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope you're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing.[A]
[0448]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight]Ward, you seem to be doing
well today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
I'm always doing great.[A]
You better do well, too, you know.[A]
You gotta make money to buy medicine
for your mother...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That's all right, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mom, she...[A]
She didn't make it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?![A]
Why didn't you tell me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If I told you, you'd be yelling at
me to go home to Myu, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think!
Myu's all alone now.[A]
Don't you care about your
own sister?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that was during a job.
I couldn't pass it up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're more stupid than I thought.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
[0449]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight]Ward, you're acting strange lately.[A]
You got something to say to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't die.[A]
You better not die.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you were killed,
what would happen to Myu?[A]
She's still just a little girl, and
she'll be forced to live on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're the same.[A]
If you were killed, Mary
would be upset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure, like that bitch
is gonna get upset over me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really don't
feel that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It's not that 'I' won't die.
'We' won't die.[A]
Eventually, we'll go home,
back to our hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's just a rundown village
with dirty rivers and no green at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it's our hometown, and
there are people waiting for us there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're right.[A]
[044A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile].....
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can tell by your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
Something tells me otherwise...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back to your
hometown after the war?[A]
If you are, I could use your help.
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help doing what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking.
You see...[A]
I have a plan to build a new village
on the Western Isles for those people[A]
who lost their homes in the war.[A]
I was wondering if you could
help out.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you me to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, lots of things.[A]
Chopping firewood, laundry, cooking..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm not a servant, you know.[A]
I'm going to live as a mercenary.[A]
Sorry, but could you ask someone
else...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So that means you'll help
us out.[A]
I knew just by looking at your
eyes that you'd understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, that's not what I said![A]
Don't put words in my mouth![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Don't lie to yourself.
You know you want to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Right, I know I don't want to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Come on, your eyes are saying
that you want to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No they're not![A]
[044B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again...[A]
I'm not helping, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trust me, you don't want to
be a mercenary.[A]
You never know when you're going
to die.[A]
And besides, you're weak.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Erg...
You'll regret saying that...[A]
You don't want to piss me off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you looking at
me like that for![A]
I once killed monsters stronger
than any human, you know![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, now that's something.[A]
What kind of beast was it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Near my village...
there's this weird cave.[A]
When I was a kid, there were rumors
rumors that the cave was filled[A]
with strange creatures.[A]
So one day I took Lot and went to
defeat them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The inside of the cave was damp...[A]
I could tell something wasn't right.[A]
Lot was scared, but I was fine.[A]
I led the way...and suddenly,
there they were.[A]
The monsters were crawling all
over the cave floor.[A]
Long, skinny bodies writhing around,
and they were all scaly and spotted..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Snakes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess they did look like snakes.
But these were no ordinary snakes.[A]
They're real monsters, with poison
and strange dances and weird moves..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...I guess.
Where is this cave?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'll go check it out on the way
way to the village site.[A]
I'm kind of curious about it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]B-But I already killed all
the monsters, so..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said they were all over
the cave floor.[A]
One might have escaped.
They're no ordinary snakes, right?[A]
I really want to see them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Erg...[A]
[044C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Well, we meet again.[A]
Well?[A]
Doesn't looking at my face make you
want to help out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But...[A]
When this war is over, it might be
a good idea to go back to my[A]
hometown.[A]
If I get bored, I might drop by
and help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have family back home?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah, I have an older sister
who's always yelling at me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
You're pretty stupid,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Stupid?[A]
What do you mean by stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got a home to return to.[A]
You've got someone waiting for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You can help us out if you want,
but you must go back home to[A]
your sister.[A]
Got it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah, you don't have to tell me...
Damn...older sister now...[A]
[044D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, don't come out front
that often.[A]
Pegasi are prey to archer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And you're frail, so make sure
you retreat if it gets dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lot!
You're such a worrier.[A]
I am a knight, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're still a knight
in training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then remember that you can
never be overly cautious in battle.[A]
The best way to stay alive
is to always be wary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Yes, sir.[A]
[044E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Thany, why do you always
go charging in like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No buts.
You know, you should be more...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Lot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]How come you're always so
concerned about me?[A]
Oh wait, I get it.[A]
Aww, I never knew you felt that
way about me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have a little sister back home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sister?[A]
Does she look like me or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's alot younger than you.
She isn't even 10 years old.[A]
So I get real worried when I'm
out here like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany, you've got an
older sister, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, not just one, but two.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then take care of yourself,
for your sister's sakes.[A]
Imagine how they'd feel
if something happened to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...you're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[044F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey, Lot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany.[A]
You seem to be doing well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See?[A]
I'm being more careful now,
right?[A]
I'm not just rushing in anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, compared to before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, just 'compared to
before', huh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something
to tell you, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
The things that you should be
careful of in battle![A]
Do you want to hear them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear
for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay...
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...[A]
Don't stress yourself
too much, big brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What the...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And that was from Lot's cute
little sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
Thany![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha![A]
[0450]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Easy, your face.[A]
All the men from that area
have features like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...They do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back home
after the war?[A]
If you are,
I could use your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.[A]
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.[A]
I want you to help build it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right,
I'll do what I can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't promise.[A]
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saying things like that already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm just saying it because
it's entirely possible.[A]
I can't be making empty promises
If I don't know whether I'll[A]
survive or not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're such a worrier
for someone so young.[A]
You'll be getting gray hairs
before you're thirty at that rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[A]
[0451]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, it's you again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the one who wanted
to build the village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right,
the plan's coming along smoothly.[A]
A free village,
open to anybody...[A]
That's my dream.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have the money to build it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, we're suddenly getting
realistic.[A]
You see...
I actually don't know.[A]
But I know of the mines in the
Western Isles, so I'm planning on[A]
going in and hitting a jackpot.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That seems pretty unrealistic to me...
...Oh, wait.[A]
I know of an old, deserted mine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I went there with Ward
when I was a kid.[A]
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ward seemed really scared,
he probably believed the rumors.[A]
We went in a little, and suddenly
Ward screamed and started running[A]
toward the entrance.[A]
So I followed him out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Was there something in there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, snakes.[A]
Lots of them.[A]
They covered the whole cave floor.[A]
I was trying to figure out why
there were snakes in there...[A]
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
So there might still be some
gold left in there.[A]
Sounds interesting.[A]
We might be able to get the money
for the village there.[A]
Say, can you take me there when
you get the chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that won't be a problem.[A]
You'll be there to protect me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Me?[A]
[0452]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, how are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I'm still alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you die.
I'm counting on you to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.[A]
And also...[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[A]
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?[A]
Well, well aren't you the lucky
man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I'm planning on going home soon,
granted that I stay alive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about that again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemy is getting stronger
all the time.[A]
I don't know how much longer I
hold out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I know that we'll win in the end...[A]
But I don't know whether I'll be
able to go home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on,
don't be so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone of your age should be
enjoying life![A]
I know you're probably worrying about
your sister and all sorts of things.[A]
But you have to go running around
more freely.[A]
You'll probably run into walls and
hit your head from time to time,[A]
but that's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't think I want to be
hitting my head.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, even if you die,
I'll take care of things for you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you can go out and get
killed without any worries![A]
...You know?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]She seemed to be saying something
different than what she was originally[A]
talking about...[A]
But...was she trying to cheer me up?[A]
[0453]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...you're Gonzales.[A]
I hear you've been doing
many evil deeds in the West.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
I want to fight with everyone.[A]
But...I useless.[A]
I become strong, everyone like me.[A]
Make me strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Very well, I shall train you.[A]
First, I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hit?[A]
I can't...[A]
You get hurt...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]Wh-Why you hit me?[A]
[OpenLeft]Did you really think that your
puny fists would hurt me!?[A]
Now hit me![A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Okay...[A]
Raaah![A]

[0454]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzales.[A]
Are you continuing with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, look.
I found this.[A]
I have more money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I become strong.
I buy armor.[A]
I not get hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]Listen![A]
Offense is everything in a battle![A]
If you kill the enemy in a single
hit, they will never get a chance[A]
to hit you![A]
Know that only weaklings wear armor![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]O-Okay...
I was wrong.[A]
I kill enemy in one hit.[A]
I buy strong axe.[A]
[OpenLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidRight]Geh.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]So you think a strong weapon
makes you powerful, do you?[A]
A true warrior fights with
the raw strength of his muscles![A]
If you have the time to go buy
weapons, train yourself instead![A]
Train yourself to the point where
you and break down walls with the[A]
swing of an iron axe![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]O-Okay...[A]
[0455]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Say nothing, Gonzales.[A]
I can tell by looking in your eyes.[A]
You have become strong.[A]
You have come a long way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you want to say,
Gonzales.[A]
And I completely agree with you.[A]
I'm happy that you have come
this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But it isn't over yet.[A]
The path to a true warrior is long
and hard.[A]
Now come, Gonzales.[A]
Let us go in search of further power![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[0456]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph...[A]
So this is a wyvern.
It has a forbidding face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...
Bartre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Young man, do you mind if I
touch it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, maybe not now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?
Hmm!?[A]
Why you...[A]
You want to fight me,
do you!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rubley,
stop![A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, he's on his toes
since we were training...[A]
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.[A]
Say, young man, you have quite some
talent.[A]
You've tamed this beast at your
young age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, any Dragon Knight can do
this much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't belittle yourself like that.
I can tell you have talent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes, you said
you were training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I've been trying to get some
speed in our offense.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you're already a powerful Dragon
Knight, but you seek to become[A]
even stronger?
Now that's a real man.[A]
I wish you luck.[A]
[0457]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, young man.[A]
Have you been continuing
your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, very good.
Men must always be strong in body.[A]
You know, the men these days
are getting softer and softer.[A]
Why, in battles I see grown
men lagging behind the women![A]
Disgraceful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
We must become stronger, as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I agree...[A]
You see, my daughter left home recently,
and I've been wondering that maybe I[A]
didn't enforce enough discipline on
her as a father...[A]
It's been bothering me for several
days now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, uh...
I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's always good to talk
with someone who understands![A]
[0458]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems we get along well.[A]
I feel I can bring out my true
strength when I'm fighting[A]
alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can also fight without worry
with you around.[A]
It's like...something big is
protecting me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, if I were to have a son, I would
have raised him into a fine young[A]
man like you.[A]
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From now on, think of me as your father
and feel free to tell me anything.[A]
Is that clear, son?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah...
Thank you very much.[A]
[0459]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hi, I'm Cass![A]
Hey, Bartre,[A]
can we talk for a bit?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure,
I don't mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
You look a lot like my father,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.
But he didn't act like you,[A]
though. He was nothing
but a coward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But talking to you
reminds me of him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Bartre,
can you hug me like[A]
my father used to?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, all right.
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Bartre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]Heh...[ToggleSmile]What an idiot.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Just like my father.[A]
[045A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bartre.[A]
Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?[A]
This is my axe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. And you see this[A]
other stuff? They're all yours.
I stole them from you[A]
the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yup, I'm a thief.[A]
I trick people and
steal their stuff. Well?[A]
Aren't you going to yell at me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Cath.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Why are you telling me this?[A]
You could have gotten away
with it, if you kept silent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah.[A]
I don't even know why I stole
from you in the first place.[A]
I usually only steal from
the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does it have something
to do with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe.[A]
I've always hated my father.
He was such a coward...[A]
I always hated him.[A]
[045B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Our village was burned to
the ground in the war.[A]
A bunch of soldiers came and
ordered us to set our houses on fire.[A]
No one did... I mean, who would?
It was our home. Soon the[A]
soldiers got impatient and drew
their swords... That's when one[A]
of the villagers took a torch
and went around setting the[A]
place on fire. That coward...
was my father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]All of our houses and
crops were burned... And even[A]
then, all my father did was
stand there and watch. ...[A]
I've hated him ever since.
I swore to myself that I[A]
would never become a coward
who goes around bowing to[A]
power like that. That's why I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cath... you're wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one would enjoy burning
down their own village.[A]
But your father... he had
something he needed to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.[A]
But he was fighting all the same.
He was gritting his teeth and[A]
fighting to protect something[A]
that was more important than
his house and crops. ...[A]
He was fighting to protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...... Ha...[A]
I don't think so.
My father's just a coward.[A]
[ToggleSmile]He's nothing like you.[A]
But... I suppose I could think
of it that way...[A]
[045C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Ray!
Ray![A]
[ToggleSmile]I said,
Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125]... I can hear you, you don't
have to shout like that.[A]
... What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
What are these?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Baked tarts, as you can see.[A]
The meal delivery man gave me some
extra ones.[A]
They look good, don't they?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Sweets...[A]
They're hard to get nowadays.[A]
You should savor them and
eat them for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They won't be good even
[ToggleSmile]if I eat them alone.[A]
So let's eat them later today.[A]
Anyway, I'll be going now.[A][ClearFace]
[......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
Oh, one more thing.[A]
You should at least respond when
you're spoken to![A]
With me, it's fine, but you shouldn't
act like that with strangers.[A]
People are going to misjudge you as
antisocial or something.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misjudge, huh?[A]
...Yeah, whatever.[A]
My good ol' brother seems to be
as naive as ever.[A]
[045D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was just wondering if you're
doing alright.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean,
all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was worried if you were
still here or not.[A]
You know... the first time you left,
you just left a note and suddenly[A]
disappeared.[A]
I was worried that you might just walk
off again without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your note said, 'I want to train my
Dark Magic skills on my own.[A]
Was... I in the way?
You didn't want me around...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No, that's not the case...[A]
I was planning on going back home
once I gained enough power as a[A]
Shaman.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ray!
I knew it![A]
I knew you were going to return
to pick up the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?
No, I never...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm so relieved![A]
You haven't changed at all, you're still
the kind-hearted Ray that I know.[A]
I'll go pray![A]
I'm going to thank God for letting me
see you again![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... hello?[A]
...Sigh...
Why is he like that?[A]
[045E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, I need to tell you
something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it, Ray?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I... I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.[A]
I... Uh...
I'll apologize for that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
I understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A-And![A]
I'll never disappear without
warning again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?[A]
Come on, please!![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is there a problem if
I'm near you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er...[A]
N-No, that's not the case,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
We never know how often we'll be
together once we grow up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If...[A]
If I don't make it through this war,
promise me you'll pick up the little[A]
ones at the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't say that.
We'll both survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah... you're right.[A]
Something's wrong with me today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't let you die.[A]
You're my brother, my only
brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Ray.[A]
[045F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
H-Hey[A]
You're Lugh, right?[A]
I, uh, I'm sorry for mistaking you
for your brother the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, Hugh, it's all right.[A]
We're twins, so no one can really
tell us apart anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man, thanks for forgiving me.[A]
I can't believe I just got pissed and
grabbed a kid by the collar like that.[A]
I'm a terrible man.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But originally it's Ray's fault
for walking off with your spell book.[A]
Then I have to apologize too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, never mind that.[A]
That was partly my fault for
being off-guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But... ...[A]
Yeah, you're right, never mind.[A]
We got to meet each other because
of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![A]
We're both magi, so let's help
each other along![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I was hoping that you would
teach me some things.[A]
[0460]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hugh![A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
What do you mean, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're bleeding from your
elbow![A]
We have to stop it...[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I got hit in that
last fight.[A]
Don't worry about it, it's
not such a big deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes it is![A]
You're not just going to leave
such a bad wound alone..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh?
You look a little pale, too...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I've suffered enough times already
from losing people close to me.[A]
...I will treat that wound.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......
All right, thanks.[A]
[0461]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry![A]
You said you were all right, but I
just ignored you and... I'm sure you[A]
didn't like a kid being so arrogant...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot, why are you apologizing
after helping me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you seemed to have been avoiding
me after that, so I thought that maybe[A]
you were mad...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was embarrassed, what do
you think![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because...[A]
No one ever cared for me that much in
my whole life...[A]
My grandma was the one who raised me,
but she was one hell of a bitch.[A]
I've gotten injuries far worse than
this one, but she wouldn't use her[A]
[ToggleSmile]staves to heal me at all![A]
I was just so happy that you
seemed to be so concerned..[A]
Lugh, thanks, man.[A]
You're now my friend forever.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!![A]
[0462]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
Phew... Sorry I'm straining you
so much, Trifinne... Good girl.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121]Wow![A]
A wyvern![A]
Wow, it's so big![A]
Is this wyvern yours?[A]
Will it get angry if I touch it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, go ahead.
She's a gentle one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...[A]
Wow, such hard scales...
Her fangs are sharp too![A]
Wow... are you a Dragon Knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, yes I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really!?[A]
I thought only Bern had Dragon
Knights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They say Bern's Dragon Knights are
invincible, so I was a little worried...[A]
But they'll be nothing if we have
Dragon Knights as well![A]
I want to defeat Bern, but I'm still
not very good with my magic, so I'm[A]
so I'm still not of much use yet...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Oh... I better get going.
See you later![A]
Thanks for letting me
pet your wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...see you...[A]
[0463]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Hello![A]
Can I give this to your wyvern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hello.
What is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I got some extra baked tarts, so I
wanted to give some to the wyvern[A]
as well.[A]
Oh wait, maybe wyverns don't eat
food like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You love them, right Trifinne?
Thank you, Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's called Trifinne?
Can I call her that, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here you go, Triffine.
Eat up.[A]
Good, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What is your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
I'm Lugh, from Lycia.
What's your name?[A]
Where are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm Miledy.
...I come from Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!!![......]
...You're joking, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry.
I couldn't get myself to say it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Lugh![A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]...I know it couldn't be avoided,
but still...[A]
I'm sorry, Trifinne, just when you
had made a cute friend...[A]
[0464]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Miss Miledy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry I ran off
like that the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm glad you're speaking to
me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I didn't want things to end like
that.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to my story?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four, and
ever since then I've been living at an[A]
orphanage in Lycia.[A]
It was a tiny orphanage, with seven
kids and just one priest whom we[A]
called Father.[A]
The oldest kids were my twin brother
Ray, and another boy called Chad, and[A]
me, so we three would take care of
the little ones.[A]
We were poor, but we were still
happy.[A]
But ever since Bern started the war,
our lives changed.[A]
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...[A]
Chad... he started stealing food without
telling Father...[A]
Ray then got fed up with that lifestyle
and suddenly left one day without[A]
telling anybody.[A]
I... We hated Bern.[A]
Bern was the one that did this to us...
Bern killed Father...[A]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[A]
..Anger keeps you going more than
sorrow...[A]
Anger has kept me alive... so that I would
be able to protect the little ones...[A]
...Phew...[A]
So...for now, until this war ends...
I have to keep my anger towards Bern.[A]
...But, you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I would be so relieved if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.[A]
If you would let me, I want to
help you as your friend... Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Miss Miledy.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dumb...
I not remember lots of words...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
It's thank you.[A]
It's an expression of gratitude.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grat...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
When someone does something for you
and you feel happy, you say[A]
'Thank you.'[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right...

They were growing in Roy's homeland,

Why are you avoiding me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sh... Shut up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah![A]
[OpenMidRight]G-Go away!
Go go go![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][ToggleMouthMove]Only hurt if talk...

I ugly, you pretty...
I not same as you.[A]
But...I never forget.
I stay human thanks to you...[A]
I never forget.[A][Clear]
...Thank you...[A][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Li...lina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That word...
You use it when you are happy.[A]
You don't use it when
you're... leaving someone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...
Crying?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You too...
Why are you crying?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales...
I want to be with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me to go away...
Please...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...?[A]
Do I see someone so foolish as to walk
by me without saying a word?[A]
Whoever it is, he seems to have a
death wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Oh!
H-Hey, Grandma![A]
What a coincidence![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't give me that rubbish![A]
Hiding as soon as you see me,
are you?[A]
You seem to be as shy as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, Grandma, you seem to
be all strong and healthy...[A]
You don't plan on dying any
time soon, do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph![A]
I can't be dropping dead leaving a
pathetic grandson like you on his own.[A]
And?[A]
It's been three years sent I sent you
out to study dark magic.[A]
I hope you have a good excuse for that
stench of anima magic that you're[A]
surrounding yourself with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I became a mage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Am I finally losing my hearing?
I thought I heard you say 'mage.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I said, I became an
anima magic user![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You... pathetic idiot![A]
And you dare show your face
in front of me!?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help!
Murder![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Idiot...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, where are you going,
Grandma?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm going insane talking to you.[A]
You better not show me that pathetic
face of yours for a long time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I thought she was going to beat
me to a pulp.[A]
Well, either she's gotten old, or she was
just stunned at how handsome I've become.[A]
Either way, lucky me![A]
[0469]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Hugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandma![.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
Oh, I'm just bracing myself so I'll be
prepared to run when you blast me with[A]
your magic.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You really are an idiot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, an idiot?
Come on, I'm your only grandson![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, unfortunately you are.
Well, there's no point in crying
over spilled milk.[A]
Anyway, I need something from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Give me back that Resire book
I gave you when I sent you out.[A]
You don't need it anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ulp...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do have it... do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Erg...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hugh, those books are hard to get![A]
If you're telling me you sold it
or something...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait!
No no no![A]
I didn't sell it![A]
I gave it away![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?
Can't you think of a better excuse?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not an excuse![A]
I met this kid who was studying dark
magic, and we traveled together for[A]
a while.[A]
I found out that the kid was an orphan,
so I kinda felt sympathetic, I guess.[A]
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the[A]
spell book![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you didn't give it away, but
you got it stolen by a child.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I guess you could put it
that way, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the only way to
put it![A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Hey, Grandma.[A]
I can leave you alone if
your head hurts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
I wouldn't be able to face your
deceased parents if I let my anger[A]
get to me and blast you to
smithereens.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
S-See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]He's just like his father...[A]
He tries to be bad, but he can't
deny his kind heart.[A]
Why couldn't he inherit his
talent for dark magic as well?[A]
[046A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandma![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I was trying to study dark
magic at first, but I couldn't[A]
seem to pick it up at all, while
that kid I was talking about was[A]
doing great just learning on his own.[A]
So I thought maybe I didn't have
the talent, so I just switched to[A]
anima magic.[A]
But the thing is, how can I not
have talent when I have your[A]
blood?[A]
So I was wondering if my old man
had the talent or not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your father had more talent with
dark magic than you could ever hope for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
That makes no sense.[A]
...Wait![A]
I got it![A]
That's it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you thinking now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not your real grandson, right!?
O-Ow![A]
What'd you do that for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm expressing my disgust at your
stupidity.[A]
You are indeed my grandson.[A]
I'm the one that brought you into
this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're kidding![A]
My good looks couldn't have
come from your wrinkled face![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.[A]
I would date men like you and dump
them after they spent all their[A]
money on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ouch...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your kindness comes from your father,
and your talent for anima magic comes[A]
from your mother.[A]
Your stupidity... that probably comes
from your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
My mom wasn't a Shaman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At first, I was determined to make
my son's wife a Shaman.[A]
But your mother was a fine young lady
with a distinct talent for anima magic,[A]
so I couldn't help but give in.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...I was proud of them both...
But they died so young.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You must be disappointed that all
you have left is a pathetic little[A]
grandson, eh, Grandma?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
The strange thing is, I'm not.[A]
I can't say how much I missed
yelling at you when you were gone.[A]
Maybe they really are cuter when
they're more troublesome.[A]
I certainly want you to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Grandma.[A]
[046B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There you are![A]
I never would've guessed you'd
be here in this army.[A]
I've been looking all over for you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well,
I sure wasn't looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Taking advantage of my kindness
like that...[A]
This is why I don't like kids.[A]
Now give me back my Resire book.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes.
That thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You haven't used it up
already, have you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Calm down, I've got it.
I was just borrowing it.[A]
I was planning on giving it
back to you some day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You little runt...[A]
You said you just wanted to see it
for a sec, so I lent it to you.[A]
I wasn't expecting you to take it
and run off![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, I've said this a million times.
I'm borrowing it, not stealing it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, when are you
going to return it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, let's see...[A]
I suppose I'll give it back
to you after I use it 20 times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You better keep your word![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh well, I guess I'll just
have to wait...[A]
Whoa, wait a minute![A]
It'll be gone by the time you use
it 20 times![A]
[046C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not letting you go this time!
Give me back that Resire book now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sorry, but I can't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're a mage.[A]
What's the point in you having
a Resire book?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...
That's not the point...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A powerful spell that could be
put to use in battle would be[A]
wasting away in your hands.[A]
Who would be responsible if we lost
a battle because we didn't use it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
F-Fine, I'll let you have it for
now.[A]
But you're going to give it back
to me with interest, you hear!?[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hmph, what an idiot.[A]
How can he be fooled by such a
lame excuse?[A]
I have yet to understand such
blatant stupidity.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Crap...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]You little...!
Give it back to me now![A]
[046D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll give you that gem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's none of your business.[A]
Anyway, I'm giving you that
in return for the spell book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nope.
I can't accept this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why not?[A]
The gem's enough to buy another
Resire book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't about money.
It's about my pride.[A]
...Let's see...
I want you to apologize to me.[A]
Then you can have the
spell book for free.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
I can't believe you're being so
stubborn over something so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, so are you.[A]
All you have to do is say
you're sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I won't.[A]
I've paid you back with the
gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not taking it.[A]
You're going to be in my
debt until you apologize![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hmph...
Adults.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What a stubborn little brat.[A]
[046E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123]One, two three...[A]
Yup, I've got it all.[A]
Looks like I can trust that Roy
to give me a steady paycheck.[A]
Well, I guess it's time to
show them my worth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C]Hey![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-What the?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Where'd you get all that money?
Are you a thief as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do I look like a thief to you?[A]
They paid me this money when I
joined.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!?
That's not fair!
I've been working for nothing all
this time![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess you're not good
enough to pay.[A]
You've got to show them your worth
if you want cash.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hmm...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll take those words as a challenge![A]
I'll show you my worth as a thief.[A]
I'll steal that money from right
under your nose![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, what!?
Fine, dammit![A]
Take it if you can![A]
[046F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Hugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What are you getting all
uptight about?[A]
I'm just trying to be friendly here.[A]
Do you really think I'll try to
steal in a place like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not trusting you anymore![A]
I'm gonna be on my guard whenever
you're around.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha, you've got such petty thoughts.[A]
You're getting all worked up about
a couple thousand gold?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Well, it's still money to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, I suppose I'm going to have some
trouble with you on your watch like[A]
that.[A]
I guess I'll pass it up for today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right!
Just give it up and go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.
But remember, Hugh![A]
I'll be back![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0470]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again!?[A]
It doesn't matter how many times
you come.[A]
I'm not giving you this money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you still saying that?
Geez![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then stop trying to take it![A]
I mean, don't you already have
a ton of money if you're a thief?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Why would I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, right![A]
I see you running around looting
chests all the time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I give it all to the poor.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm a master thief, I have my
dignity.[A]
I would never even keep 1G of the
money I steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
Are you going to give the money you
take from me to the poor as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hey...[A]
You can have maybe a hundred...[A]
No...[A]
I can give you around half of this
money to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
I'm a master thief,
I have my dignity.[A]
I don't take offers
from other people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I said no.
I don't want it.[A]
Besides...[A][Clear]
I've already got your money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
What... what the hell!?
When did you switch...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Cass![A]
Wait![A]
Just wait a second, please![A]
[0471]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]?
...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you use dark magic.[A]
Although it looks like you're
still a beginner.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!
...Look, old lady.[A]
I'm busy.[A]
I don't have time to spare on old
folk like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come now, there's no need to rush.[A]
Studying on your own isn't going to
get you anywhere, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
How do you know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I haven't lived this long
for nothing, boy.[A]
I think I've seen more darkness
than you have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who...[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My name is Niime.[A]
You should remember your
elders' names...[A]
[0472]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's the rude little
chap from the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You...you're 'The Hermit on the
Mountain.'[A]
The master of darkness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I see I've become famous.
What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I...
I want you to teach me your dark magic.[A][Clear]
Teach me all of it![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Boy, is that how you ask
people for favors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'll change my tone if you
don't like it.[A]
If you want me to bow my head to the
ground and apologize, I'll do it.[A]
So please, teach me your dark magic![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Hm, interesting...[A]
...All right, try reading this
for a start.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What...is this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can't you tell?[A]
It's an archaic language used
in the oldest spells.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
The ancient scrolls I know
aren't written like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand how deep
dark magic is now?[A]
I'll give you that.
Good luck reading it.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...[A]
Of course I'll read it...[A]
[0473]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Well?
How's your studying going?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
Don't even have the time to talk,
eh?[A]
You're a rude one, and you don't
Know how to respect your elders.[A][Clear]
But you seem to be serious about
learning dark magic.[A]
Boy, why do you seek the power
of darkness?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...It's not like I have some grandiose
reason.[A]
I use dark magic for myself.[A]
I want to protect those I hold dear,
and destroy all those who oppose me.[A]
That's the power I seek.[A]
The power you're trying to obtain...[A]
It's not to be taken lightly.[A]
It can tilt the planet if used
incorrectly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...so?[A]
I'll blow up a planet or two any day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
Well said, boy.[A]
Now come... come into the
depths of darkness...[A][Clear]
Of course, you're going to
have to study that book first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Nothing.[A]
[0474]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Hello...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you're the priestess of Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
My name... is Sophia...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A shy one, aren't we?[A]
Well, I suppose anyone would be shy
after spending her whole life in[A]
that place...[A]
You're just like me when I was
your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My name is Niime.[A]
I want to know more about
your village in Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About the village...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
Oh, before that...
Are you human, or Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I am human...[A]
At least...my father was human...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Forget about it.
Sorry for being so intrusive.[A]
[0475]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Arcadia...is inside the sandstorm...[A]
There aren't many Dragons...
But there are many people... who have[A]
Dragon blood... in them...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said you were a priestess,
but what exactly do you do?[A]
Do you go around doing rain dances?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...can see...
[OpenMidLeft]See?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can sometimes see...
the future...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Really?[A]
Is that because of the Dragon's
blood in you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I...don't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
You'd better not tell that to anyone
else.[A]
Your power would be too dangerous for
our enemies.[A]
Even knowing the next day's weather
could make or break a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Not all outsiders are nice people.[A]
I heard you were being held captive
by Bern, but you don't want to go[A]
through that again, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I don't...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Don't worry.[A]
Roy wouldn't think of taking advantage
of you.[A]
You're safe here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[0476]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are Dragons, anyway?
Where do they come from?[A]
What are they here for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know...[A]
I don't know... anything specific...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... I see.[A]
You don't know anything about the
Dragons, but you have their blood[A]
in you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you were a normal girl, you could
lead an ordinary life, not having[A]
people hunt you down for your power...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I... This is me...[A]
Even the Dragon blood that flows in
me... it is what makes me who I am...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... you're right.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You are a strong one.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me... strong...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're strong.[A]
You really are just like me
when I was your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... I see...[A]
[0477]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you over there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hey![A]
Can you not hear me,
or are you just ignoring me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Uh...
...Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is there anyone else here?[A]
Geez, are you deaf, or just
plain stupid?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I heard you use ancient
dark magic.[A]
Is it true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Let me see your spell books.
I don't think I've ever seen...[A][MoveMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Ow![A]

What the...[A]
Did you just do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Please... don't touch...

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Well, well...
You dare stand up to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ah, fine.
I'll leave you alone for now.[A]
But you're showing me that
spell book next time we meet![A][ClearFace]

Y-You!?
Damn, how could I not have
noticed you coming so close...[A]
Wh-What do you want!?[A]
Are you trying to pay me
back for the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The dark magic book![A]
The one they don't know even
exists...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes...
...You know much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I do![A]
Do you have any idea how long
I've been looking for this!?[A]
[ToggleSmile]So this is it...[A]
Wow...
I can feel it's power...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Do you want it...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can have it!?
But... are you sure?[A]
Don't you need it as well?
Why give it to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait! Hey![A]
[0479]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you over there!
You![A]
With the long dragging hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm giving this spell book
back to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?
...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't need things to be
given to me.[A]
I'm not a beggar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes...[A]
...But...
I wanted to give it... to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Because...
You are a good person...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always act strong...[A]
...But... you actually have a kind
heart... So... I wanted to give[A]
it to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have a kind heart!?[A]
Only my brother ever said something
as ridiculous as that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I know you... better than you
know yourself...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Don't talk like that.
You'll scare people off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Well, it doesn't bother me, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Thank you...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What's your name?
I'm Ray.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Ray...[A]
My name... is Sophia...[A]
[047A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Lalam.
What's up?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's happening with the plan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, the plan about
building that village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
Yeah, I've been going around
recruiting help.[A]
Are you going to help out, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
What do you want me to do?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Dance, of course.[A]
Your dancing cheers everyone up.[A]
It makes people feel like getting up
and working some more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think so?[A]
Hmm...
Well, I can cook, too.[A]
You know my Special Stamina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since I started the rebellion,
I've been eating your...[A]
I can't even bear to say it in
words.[A]
Anyway, I wouldn't call it food.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never!
I've always been trying...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, Lalam.[A]
You usually don't end up burning
the house down when you cook a[A]
proper meal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not a big loss, considering
how well my food tastes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The wails and moans of the rebel leaders...
I can still hear them echoing in my ears.[A]
Has Elphin ever eaten it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.
But he didn't say anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You see?[A]
There's something wrong with everyone
else's taste buds.[A]
My food was probably too high-
class for them.[A]
Maybe...[A]
Roy might appreciate my fine
taste.[A]
Yes![A]
I'm sorry, Echidna.[A]
I have to make Roy try my cooking![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry, Roy...[A]
[047B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Oh, Echidna.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalam.
Hey...[A]
You were talking about feeding
that stuff to Roy, but...[A]
did you really do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean!?
He praised me![A]
He said that it was really...[Clear]
uh...that it looked really good.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So he ate it, huh?
[ToggleSmile]When's the funeral?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph![A]
I just wasn't doing too well that
day!
My stepfather always said that
he loved my cooking.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, now, even if you can't cook, your
dancing is still the best in the world.[A]
I should be working hard, too, to let
the people live in peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You know,
you're really noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're always thinking about others.[A]
Even this, building a village so that
other people can live in peace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're like those heroes that appear
in the sagas that bards sing![A]
You appear, help the needy, and leave
as suddenly as you had come...[A]
You're also mysterious since you never
tell anybody about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right...I don't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I won't ask.[A]
I'm really curious, but there must be
an important reason why you won't[A]
tell us.[A]
[047C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Hey, Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just had a really
great idea![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you want to hear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm sure.
[ToggleSmile]Come on, let's hear it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay.[A]
I was thinking, when the village is
done, let's put a statue there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A statue?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A statue of you![A]
It can have an engraving that says,
'A great hero lies here...'[A]
or something like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey,
I don't plan on dying yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway, it's your village, so there
has to be a statue of you somewhere.[A]
Make sure you think of a pose for it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]She's an odd girl...[A]
Well, I guess that's nothing
new.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]Oh, one more thing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you go disappearing on us!
We all love you, you know.[A]
Don't you dare try and
run off![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah... I know, Lalam.[A]
[047D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek!
A pirate![A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Wait a minute![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek![MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Help help help![A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Stop...
Wait![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Pirates are all the same.[A]
You're just going to say shut up, or
you'd better not say a word if you[A]
want to live, or something like that.[A]
Oh![A]
Lalam's in grave danger!
But just you wait.[A]
Soon Roy'll appear on a shining
white stallion and rescue me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, are you done?[A]
Listen.
I'm not a pirate anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph![A]
Even if you try to act good like
that, I know better![A]
I know you're trying to run off
with me because I'm so irresistible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You've got to be kidding me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Kidding!?[A]
What, are you saying that I'm
not cute enough to kidnap!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...[A]
No...forget it.
Sorry to bother you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait![A]
[047E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeek!
It's the pirate again![A]
[OpenMidRight]I said I'm not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still trying to cover
up the obvious truth?[A]
Your hairstyle, your clothes...[A]
Everything about you is just
screaming, 'I'm a pirate!'[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Fine...
Have it your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aha!
You admit it![A]
And?[A]
You're still trying to
run off with me, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey...[A]
Would you please listen
to what I have to say...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh!
Lalam's in great danger![A]
But just you wait.[A]
[0x0080][0xC282]oy'll beat you down any day![A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[ToggleSmile]'Are you all right, Lalam?'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Oh, Master Roy...'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Lalam,
I can't live without you.'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Oh, thank you, Master Roy...'[A][Clear]
And then we...
[MoveLeft]Ooooohhhh![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hey,
where are you doing?[A]
[OpenFarRight]See you later...[A]
Talking with you is exhausting.[A]
[047F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the pirate![A]
Are you still trying to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is yours, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
I lost this ribbon the other day.
Wait![A]
I get it.[A]
You stole it, right!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why the hell would I return it
to you!?[A]
I found it lying on the ground, and
I thought it might be yours.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have if you let me![A]
You just start screaming
whenever we meet![A]
If only you'd stop and
listen once in a while...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you weren't a bad person after all.
I shouldn't have been so scared, then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hey, wait.[A]
I'll show you a special dance
in return.
Hey, wait...[A]
What![A]
Are you trying to tell me my
dancing isn't worth watching!?[A]
[0480]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
Are you looking out for me,
Tate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, you've been retired
for a while now, so...[A]
I'm sure you'll be all right,
but anything can happen, right?[A]
I was a little worried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks...
But I'll be fine.[A]
How about you?[A]
How is your work as a flight leader
going?[A]
You're responsible, so I thought
you'd be all right, but did you[A]
get along okay with your squad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't do anything special...
[ToggleSmile]but I think I did all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'm sure you did fine,
Tate.[A]
Good girl...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
You don't like having your
head petted anymore?[A]
You used to love it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]T-That was a long time ago...[A]
I'm not...you know,
a kid anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you don't like it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not that I don't
like it, but...you know...[A]
[0481]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing.[A]
I was just wondering whether
you're all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, Tate.[A]
Let's chat a little.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's okay, Tate.[A]
You can be my little sister
when we're alone together.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You're a strong girl,
but you easily get lonely...[A][Clear]
Do you remember the time when I
first left to go train as a[A]
Pegasus Knight?[A]
You thought I was leaving forever,
and you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D-Don't bring that up...![A]
I was still a little girl
back then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was glad you cared so much
about me, Tate.[A]
You were always so blunt, so at times
I thought you didn't like me at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...you cried so much at that time.
You were sobbing, 'Don't go, Yuno.'[A]
I felt like crying myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate, if you're ever feeling down,
come talk to me.[A]
Because... I'll always be
your big sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0482]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight]Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe you should leave the rest of
the battle up to us and rest a bit.[A]
You know you're a mother now, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
Should the old ladies be stepping
back now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No, that's not what I mean.
I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, Tate.
Thank you.[A]
But I'll be fine.
I am still an Ilian Pegasus Knight.[A]
Don't forget, I taught you how to ride
your pegasus in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know, but...[A]
[ToggleSmile]......
If something happens...[A]
I'll be there for you,
Yuno.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Thank you, Tate.[A]
[0483]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]It's big sister Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany.
Have you been well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes!
Really well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's already been a year since you
left for training...[A]
Are you getting along with the
members of the mercenary band?[A]
I heard they were all men,
but are you doing all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I'm doing fine!
They're all really nice people.[A]
And I'm doing really well in
battle, too![A]
I'm the one doing all the work.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then![A]
After we joined Master Roy, the enemies
started getting stronger...[A]
But still it's as if I defeated all
of them![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow...
That's amazing.[A]
You've been working hard, Thany...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tehe...[A]
[0484]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it,
Thany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teach me how to ride a
pegasus like you.[A]
The way you fly is really neat.
I wish I could fly like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'd like to, but not now.
We're in a battle.[A]
I can teach you when we
have some free time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The let's practice our move![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Move...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Triangle Attack![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that move mother used to
tell us about...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But we need Tate to do
the Triangle Attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... right.
[ToggleSmile]Then, um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter,
Thany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We just met after a long time,
right?[A]
I don't want us to be separated
so quickly again...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always used to stick to me like
that ever since you were little.[A]
Thany, I want you to be a good girl
and wait until the war is over.[A]
Then you can be close to me however
much you want...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... you're right.[A]
Okay![A]
[0485]
.o ait seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose[A]
there's still hope for this world.[A]
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a[A]
while, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.[A]
Don't mess up, you got that?[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...[A]
[0486]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany.[A]
I haven't told you this yet, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]While you were away,
we had a baby girl.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
A baby between you and Zealot!?
Where, where?[A]
I want to carry her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't bring her to the
battlefield, Thany.[A]I entrusted her to the
nannies back home.[A]
You can see her when
we go home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yay![A]
Yuno's baby...
she must be so cute![A]Oh, I really want to see her![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You will, don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait.[A]
Then...
That makes me an...aunt?[A]
But I'm still so young...[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno, um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?
What is it, Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our daughter...
Is she all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm sure she is.[A]
I've entrusted her to a good friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just...
What's she like?[A]
Does she look like you or me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you haven't seen her yet,
have you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.
I've always been out working.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We shall go pick her up
once the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...we shall.[A]
[0487]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno,
I was thinking...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think it's a good idea to
leave a newborn baby with someone else.[A]
You should go back home and take
care of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's all right.[A]
I've entrusted her to a very
good friend of mine.
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you're her mother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fighting because I'm her mother.[A]
I want to raise her in a
peaceful time without war.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I might have told you this before, but
it would be impossible to find a[A]
completely safe place until we end
this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]In that case,
let's focus on ending this war.[A]
All right, Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
[0488]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]You're coming back to Edessa
once the war ends, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you always stay with
us after that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Probably not...[A]
I'll have to lead the mercenary knights
around looking for work as usual.[A]
We can't support ourselves otherwise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But we've cultivated most of
Ilia's lands now.[A]
If we put our best efforts in,
we could produce enough food...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But that wouldn't happen overnight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Besides, we wouldn't be guaranteed
a good harvest every year.[A]
Where would the money for our food
come from if the crops were to fail?[A]
How would we survive the winter if
we're not prepared for a failure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I must lead the mercenary knights and
collect money until we are able to[A]
to support ourselves even in times
when the crops do fail.[A]
I'll leave Edessa to you, so you
should do your best to cultivate[A]
the land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I have faith that there will come
a time when we will have good harvests[A]
in Ilia as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have faith, too.[A]
I know that there will come a time
when we will always be together[A]
[0489]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127]Treck?[......][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh...he was here just a minute
ago...[A]
Hm?[A]
What's this... did he drop it when
he left?[A]
It has a lot of small writing
on it...[A]
Let's see...[A]
...'I became a horse.'[A]
...'I tried running.'[A]
...'I got tired.'[A]
...???[A]
[048A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight]Oh, Treck.
I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, hullo,
Lady Yuno.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You look as sleepy as usual.
Oh, right... Here.[A]
Is this yours?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Ah...
Yeah, It's mine.[A]
I lost it the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought so.[A]
I'm sorry, but I read a
little bit of it...[A]
What are you writing about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I write down what kind of
dreams I have on this piece of paper.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dreams?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
When I look at it, I remember all
the kinds of dreams I've had so far,[A]
and it helps me sleep well.[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I see.
That sounds interesting...[A]
Maybe I should try, too.[A]
[048B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127]
[OpenMidRight]Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you show me that paper
with your dreams on it?[A]
It seems I've become interested
in it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uhm... Sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][Clear]
'I was praised by General Zealot.'[A]
He comes out in your dreams
too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, he does.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's see...[A]
'The war ended.'[A]
'It became peaceful.'[A]
'Spring came to Ilia.'[A]
'Everyone lived and slept
happily ever after...'[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Is something wrong,
Lady Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No, I'm sorry.[A]
......[A]
Can you show me your dreams
sometime again, Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
It's kind of embarrassing, to
tell you the truth.[A]
But okay, you can see them.[A]
I'll go to sleep so you
can get the latest ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Treck.[A]
[048C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Noah.[A][OpenMidRight]Hello, Lady Yuno.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're worried about me?[A]
What a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm not that antisocial,
Lady Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was just kidding.[A]
You seem uncaring, but on
the inside, you have a kind heart.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
You've gone through many
battles coming here, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.[A]
General Zealot helped us greatly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It's thanks to him I'm
alive right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
He always strains himself
in battle...[A]
[048D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sigune...
She turned to Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
She ambushed us in the blizzard
with her Pegasus Knight squad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Sigune and I used to be
rivals, you know.[A]
We were always competing
against each other.[A]
It all seems so... faraway
when I remember it now.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sigune always tried to act bad, but
she was really a kindhearted person.[A]
If only we weren't in times like
this, we could have...[A]
War is a painful thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Yes.[A]
But that's what war is.[A]
[048E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to avoid developing
close relationships.[A]
Is that because you don't want to
suffer from losing that person?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wonder.[A]
It is easier to just avoid
getting close with anyone.[A]
The tighter the bond, the greater
your suffering when that bond is[A]
broken.[A]
...I think you know that better
better than any of us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Perhaps it's better to live
like you do in Ilia.[A]
But there will come a time when you
will realize that close relationships[A]
aren't all bad.[A]
Maybe you'll understand when you fall
yourself in love with someone.[A]
[048F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey!
Big sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Thany, this is a battlefield.[A]
What if an archer heard you
screaming like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.
No archer could hit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sigh...[A]
...Thany, where are your reins?[A]
You could fall off your
pegasus without them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well,
I took them off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Took them off?[A]
Thany, you never know what
can happen.[A]
So considering all possibilities...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thany, you're such a worrier![A]
Flying is more enjoyable without
all the extra gear on.[A][Clear]
See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, wait!
I'm not finished yet...[A][Clear]
...Sigh.[A]
[0490]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tate...
You're starting to get annoying...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm saying these things
for your sake.[A]
If you can't listen to your big
sister, I won't let you ride on[A]
a pegasus any more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany, it's your fault.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're always like that![A]
Always saying I'm the one to blame...[A]
You could say it in a little...
kinder tone...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But!
That's because you...![A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I hate you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany...
Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What the?!
What did you just do?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yuno, she... she used to
pet our heads like this, right?[A]
I'm your big sister too..[A]
So I thought I should make
you feel better...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany, I'm sorry..[A]
I can't be kind like Yuno,
can I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate...[A]
... Did you hit your
head or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......
This child...[A]
All right, I don't care anymore.[A]
You can fend for yourself
from now on![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait!
Sorry![A]
I just had to say it..[A]
[0491]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey!
Tate![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry about the other day.[A]
But I was really happy that
you cared about me so much.[A]
I really love you, big sister
Tate![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]... How can you say such things
without getting embarrassed...[A]
I really envy you sometimes..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?
Do you love me, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...There's no need to say that
out loud..[A]
[OpenMidRight]You... don't love me..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's just that...[A]
You don't have to say it here,
in the middle of...[A][OpenMidRight]Oh... I...
didn't know.[A]
Thany...
you always hated me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, all right!
I love you![A]
[ToggleSmile]Of course I love you.
You're my only little sister.[A]
I'll...
I'll always care for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee... Thanks!
See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]That child...[A]
[0492]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Zealot, I'm sure you know
already, but my mission has been[A]
accomplished.[A]
Still, I wish to remain in this
army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.[A]
You know, fate can work in strange
ways.[A]
We were hired by the Lycia Alliance
Army, and you were hired by the[A]
Etrurian Army...[A]
I never thought that we would meet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Although Etruria didn't seem to
view us very highly, General[A]
Klein was caring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.[A]
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I understand.[A]
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.[A]
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.[A]
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and[A]
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's Yuno.[A]
[0493]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering...[A]
Yuno's... your parents...[A]
What were they like?[A][OpenMidLeft]Haven't you heard from Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
All I know is that they were
soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our mother was a
Pegasus Knight.[A]
Our parents were killed together
on the same battlefield when we were[A]
still young.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We had no other relatives to depend
on...[A]
Yuno became our mother, when she
was only a teenager...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]While an ordinary girl of her age
would be concerning herself with[A]
romance, Yuno had to be our mother.[A]
But she never complained...
She always looked after us..[A]
With a smile on her face.
That's why...[A]
That's why I always wanted
Yuno to find happiness.[A]
[0494]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight]...I have to thank you for
helping us with the wedding.[A]
You set up the place and
cooked for us..[A]
Oh, and Yuno was very pleased with the
wedding gift you and Thany sent us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really...?[A]
I actually didn't want to send
it...[A]
But Thany won't listen once
she's made up her mind.[A][OpenMidRight]Hahaha...[A]
That was an interesting gift, though.[A]
But...[A]
I have to apologize to Yuno about
that wedding.[A]
If only I had more...[A]
If only our nation were wealthier,
I could have given her a more[A]
proper and elegant wedding..[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I doubt Yuno feels that way at
all.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm very grateful to you,
General Zealot.[A]
Your wedding...[A]
I had never seen Yuno with such a
happy face before.[A]
I want to thank you for what
you've done for her.[A]
[0495]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Zealot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thany.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey Zealot...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh wait, you're now my brother
because you're Yuno's husband...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can call me as you
wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
I wanted to ask you something.[A]
How did you meet Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Perhaps some other time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?
Don't be mean.[A]
Come on, tell me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm not being mean...[A]
You'll understand when you grow up,
but you shouldn't go around asking[A]
things like that..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But I really want to know...[A]

As your sister, I should know
these things...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zealot?
Wait![A]
[0496]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Zealot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You won't let me go,
will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But I'm family to you.[A]
I want to know about my relatives...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
All right, I suppose...[A]
...We first met in battle in Etruria[A]
Yuno's pegasus squad was hired by
our enemy side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I attempted to settle things
peacefully through discussion.[A]
Yuno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.[A]
And then, things just
progressed after that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What were your proposal words?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-You want me to tell you
that much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I'm your family... aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Did you propose first?
Or was it Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[0497]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]But I'm glad you turned
out to be a good person.[A]
You and Yuno really looked
perfect together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
I'm relieved you didn't
start hating me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why would I hate you?
You're strong, you're kind..[A]
And besides, you're the man Yuno
fell in love with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]By the way...[A]
What about you?
Do you have someone in mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sorry, that's a secret![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-What?[A]
After making me confess that much,
you're not telling me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're family.[A]
Family members have to have some
secrets![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Wait, Thany...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]See ya![A]
[0498]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][.....][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Behind you![A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Darn...![A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry, Miledy.[A]
I was too focused on the
enemies in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gale looked out for me like
this a lot, too.[A]
If we can survive by helping each
other out, then so much the better.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But it would be better if I
could fend for myself..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're still learning.[A]
It's all right, I'll protect
you until you grow strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Thanks.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight]But...that won't do.[A]
I have to become strong enough
so I can protect her...![A]
[0499]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Slow down![A]
You have to be more careful![A]
[OpenMidRight]I've got him![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't rush like that![A]
You were lucky you were able
to kill him...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right... I was able to kill him.
It's all right, Miledy.[A]
I was fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't mean you'll win
the next time![A]
[OpenMidRight]... But it doesn't mean I'll
lose, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss...[A]
Why can't you listen to your big
sister?[A]
I would never be able to forgive myself
if I let something happen to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You don't trust me, do you.[A]
Am I so weak that I can't even be
relied on?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss, I'm not saying that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Stop being a child.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...
Stop treating me like one![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A][Clear]
...Why...?[A]
[049A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]That's it![A]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x12A]Miledy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
What were you thinking, taking a
blow for me like that!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...So you also sometimes forget to pay
attention to the enemies around you,[A]
too, huh?[A]
Are you all right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Zeiss... What about you?
Aren't you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just a scratch.
Miledy, your arm is bleeding..[A]
Hang on, I'll go get some vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thanks for saving me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why wouldn't I?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...That Zeiss, protecting me?[A]
He's grown up so quickly...[A]
Well, it's no wonder he got angry when
I treated him like a child.[A]
[049B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pr...
Prince Mildain...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Your Highness!
You were alive!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......Have you mistaken me for
[ToggleSmile]someone?[A]
I'm Elphin...
A simple bard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
You are...![A]
But...
No, it can't be...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
Nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then I shall be off now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...He...[A]
He looks just like him.
...Too much like him...[A]
[049C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can I help you,
General Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you ever visited
Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not yet...[A]
I have been traveling through the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then do you know about the three
Etrurian Generals?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Yes, I do.[A]
There is you, the Sorcery General, in
addition to the Great General and the[A]
Knight General.[A][OpenMidRight]You are very knowledgeable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a bard, it is only natural that
I would hear about such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You insist on playing dumb,
do you?[A]
Then I have an idea as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let me see your right shoulder that
you are conveniently hiding with[A]
[ToggleSmile]your long hair.[A]
If you are but a simple bard as you
say you are, then there wouldn't be[A]
a scar from taking a powerful magic
hit, now, would there?[A]
May I have a look..?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Persistent, aren't you, Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
It is you, Prince Mildain![A]
What happened?[A]
Why did you not tell me that
you were alive?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I did not want to get you
caught up in this.[A]
But it seems I have no
choice now.[A]
[049D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cecilia...[A]
How much longer are you going to
stay mad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I understand why you were hiding your
identity from me, prince.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But, your Highness, you told Lord
Douglas.[A]
Did you not have enough trust
to let me know as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not what I intended...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall let it go for now,
Your Highness.[A]
I will be looking forward to your
explanation after the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Scary, as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have saddened not only me,
but your people as well.[A]
Please show our people that you
are safe, your Highness.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
I know, Cecilia.[A]
[049E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're a pirate,
right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?
Yeah...I guess.[A]
[ToggleSmile]That's what I look like,
huh?[A]
Man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I used to be a seagoing
merchant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
You must've made a lot money, then.
Lucky you.[A]
Oh well, I guess we poor people have
to just keep working hard..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's my bag doing in your
hand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Y-You're pretty perceptive,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Gee, thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm...
All right![A]
There's no treasure I can't
steal![A]
Be ready the next time
we meet![A]
[049F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Geeeese.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ohhh...
I think I'm drunk...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Can you stay and revive me?
Come on..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Were you hit with a
Berserk staff or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whatever you're doing, it's
not very convincing at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
You withstood my seduction moves!?
You're no ordinary man![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Gee, thanks.[A]
But you know, I'm not really
suited for that role.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I-I know that!
I was just testing you![A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll get serious next time.[A]
I'll take your stuff
without you even noticing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.
Good luck.[A]
[04A0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Geese![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Doesn't this look familiar?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, that's my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Hehe![ToggleMouthMove][A]
Guess you weren't so good after
all![A]
There's no treasure I can't steal![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, let's see now.
What have we got in here?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]... ... ... ...
... ... ...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What...
What the heck?!
This is nothing but junk![A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not junk.
Maps, compasses...[A]
It's equipment you need for sailing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What about treasure?!
Where's the treasure?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahaha, there never was
any treasure![A]
I'm broke.[A]
Drowning in debt,
to tell you the truth.[A]
I got nothing you can steal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Erg...[A]
How come you're bragging like
that?![A]
You're broke![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've got a dream.[A]
I'm gonna go back to being
a trader and hit a jackpot.[A]
You'll see, I'll fill my ship
with riches in no time.[A]
Then you'll have something
to steal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].........[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Did... Did I lose?
Are you a big shot?[A]
...Or just an idiot?[A]

[04A1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You must be one of Ilia's
mercenary knights.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
I'm Treck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Miledy.
Pleased to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am a Dragon Knight from Bern,
as you probably suspected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
What do you think of the fact that
a knight from Bern is fighting[A]
alongside you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
You know, so what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S... So what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like people from Bern
have seven ears or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Well, yes, I only have two.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]See?[A]
We're all brothers and sisters,
you know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do... you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yup.[A]
[04A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Ahh...
That hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,
Sir Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
Um, you're...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Miledy.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
I was just sitting here watching
you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Watching me fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
My neck aches now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.
And I was kinda thinking...[A]
Maybe you have a loved one in
Bern?[A]
Like family or a lover or
something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...N-No, that's not the case.
I live for Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, okay.
Yeah, I thought so.[A]
My assumptions are usually wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh well, guess I hurt
my neck for nothing.[A]
[04A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Um, you're...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Miledy.[A]
Do you always forget
people's names?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's a hobby.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You are an odd individual,
Sir Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
I think I'm pretty normal.[A]
Everyone tells me that they envy me
because I look like I have no worries[A]
or anything.[A]
I have my concerns too, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the other day I dreamed
I was a horse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A horse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think this dream has some kind
of hidden meaning somewhere...[A]
It's been bothering me for some
time now, and I've only been able[A]
to sleep at night.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
Thank you,
Sir Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I feel a little better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
Why would that be?[A]
[04A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Whoa.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
My god, you're huge.[A]
And look at your build.[A]
You must be able to pull trees
right out of the ground.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, this is quite a find.[A]
There's no way that I'm letting
you go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
What?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
...I go now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait a minute.[A]
[04A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait!
[ToggleSmile]I need a favor from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.
It has to be you.[A]
You see, there's going to be a new
village built on the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are lots of people who
lost their homes in this war.[A]
There are even a lot of them from the
resistance group that I was with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lost home...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So we've decided to build a village
for those people.[A]
And we need help, you see.[A]
It'd be really great if we get some
strong men like you.[A]
What do you say?[A]
If you sign up now, you'll get
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,[A]
five days a week.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But... I ugly...[A]
I can't stay with people.
They not like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, don't be ridiculous.[A]
Just try carrying in a couple of huge
logs with that strength of yours.[A]
Everyone'll love you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Love me...?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I help you.[A]
[04A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...[A]
What...
What's your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
I hadn't told you yet.[A]
I'm...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I dumb.
I can't remember things...[A]
...And I ugly.
Everyone looks at me...[A]
I ugly, dumb...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...My, my.[A]
Look, Gonzales, you have to have
more confidence in yourself.[A]
Yeah, you have a scary face, and
you're a bit dumber than most others.[A]
But so what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, Gonzales.[A]
I won't say that 'As long as you
have a kind heart...' crap.[A]
You're ugly.[A]
People make fun of you because of
it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
But that doesn't mean that you
should just give up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You should look over yourself carefully,
and find something that only you have.[A]
You'll eventually find something
that's unique to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, unique to you.[A]
If you have that, no one will
be making fun of you anymore.[A]
You won't have to belittle
yourself all the time.[A]
You can stand proud.[A]
[OpenMidRight]U...Unique...?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I go think.[A][......]
My head hurts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahaha...
Take all the time you need.[A]
[04A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmm...?[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me?[A]
I... I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Treck.
Nice to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]T...T...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck Treck Treck Treck Tre...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, don't repeat it so
much like that.[A]
You're embarrassing me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shut up.
I forget.[A]
...ck Treck Treck Tre...
Okay, I remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, you're an odd one.
Hey, are you...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Um...[A]
Sorry, what was your name again?[A]
[04A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh?[A]
You, you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who are you?
I see you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I must be famous.[A]
My name is Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]T...T...
T...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...reck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reck.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
Hey, what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
It's really calm,
don't you think...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm...[A]
What's calm...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm? ...Hmm...[A]
You know, I don't really
know either.[A]
But hey, don't worry about it.[A]
It's nothing compared to the
size of this world.[A]
[04A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahhh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's so peaceful here...[A]
You know, we could make quite a
team, don't you think?[A]
Um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
Oh yeah, my name is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You Reck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Was it?[A]
Now that you say so,
I think you're right.[A]
Well, no matter.
Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[04AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot,
are you all right?[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
This is nothing.
We are knights of Ilia.[A]
We wouldn't lose to other nations'
knights in terms of battle experience.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
Well, I still have a lot to
learn, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.[A]
...Oh.[A]
Noah, have you written your letter
yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Letter?
Oh...that letter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
Remember what you were told
when you first joined?[A]
There are Pegasus Knight messengers
that fly with us.[A]
If he should fall in battle,
they will deliver our letters for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither of us will be able to meet
our deaths peacefully in bed.[A]
The letters are essential to us.[A]
Noah, don't you have anyone
you want to send a letter to?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well... Not really.[A]
I do recall my comrades were
writing letters, though.[A]
They were addressing them to
their parents.. .or lovers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You should do the same.[A]
Why don't you get a girlfriend
yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll think about it.[A]
[04AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...General Zealot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is it about the letter?[A]
Have you changed your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I suppose even I have someone I want
to send a letter to when I die.[A]
If I die, I want you to read my
letter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Treck and I...
And also Grant and Sieks...[A]
We all made it here thanks
to you.[A]
I'd like to express my
gratitude to you when I die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Speaking of the others...
I wonder where they are now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've no idea.[A]
But they were once under my command.
They won't die so easily.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that some were hired
by Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But that can't be helped.[A]
We give our blood and get money
in return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...General Zealot,
what do you think of that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.[A]
They say that we are vultures
attracted to blood and decaying meat.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't bother me.[A]
It's a fact that Ilia couldn't
survive without war.[A]
We are giving our own blood
as well to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[04AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot?[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
No...nothing's wrong.
Did I seem troubled?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I just thought that
something had happened.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
...A letter arrived today.
It was your comrade's...[A]
Grant's will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Would you like to read it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.[A]
Then let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[04AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Uh...[A]
Oh, Noah...
You were there?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I've been here for
a while now.[A]
Well, I'm used to it, so I don't mind
you falling asleep every ten seconds.[A]
But you know, don't you have anything
else to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like practicing your swings during
marches, or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
How about you?[A]
Have you been doing anything?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
...Not really.[A]
...I guess I'm no different from
you, then.[A]
Hey, what were you doing back
in Ilia during the break?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I slept.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I mean other than that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
Oh, I went fishing.[A]
You know how the lakes freeze
over in the winter?[A]
You punch holes in the ice with your
spear and lower some string inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds exactly like something you
would do.[A]
What can you catch?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nothing.[A]
It's just fun to sit there staring
off into space holding the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really live life to the
fullest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What were you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Nothing much, really.[A]
[04AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]Treck, do you remember Casis?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Casis?[A]
Hmm...[A]
I sort of remember that name...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't remember?[A]
He's the guy that forgot to bring
his weapons to our first mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
He was getting scolded with me
by General Zealot.[A]
He even forgot to bring his horse,
you know.[A]
He was fighting on foot![A]
I never thought there'd be someone
dumber than me in our squad.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, he's dead.[A]
He was hired by Bern...
He died close to here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mercenaries are in high demand
right now...[A]
We could have ended up fighting
him if we were unlucky.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're for hire, you know.
It happens.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess you're right...[A]
I really envy that personality
of yours...[A]
[04AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm?
Something wrong, Noah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I was just thinking some things
over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thinking things over?
Don't bother.[A]
We're not made to be thinking
deeply like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I guess.[A]
You know, this war...[A]
I mean, I never meant to go out and
save the world or anything, but we've[A]
fought through a lot of battles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Ilia's the same as always.
Our kids, and our kids' kids...[A]
They'll be fighting to make a living,
just like we do.[A]
I was just wondering...
Couldn't we do anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Maybe it's just futile for us
to try and make a difference...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
That's all right, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.
At least I think so.[A]
We go through hard times, but
isn't that all part of life?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
...Hey, Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take me along the next
time you go fishing.[A]
[04B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Treck?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oww!?[A]
What...what the?
How come my head hurts so much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because I just hit you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?
General Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck, you were sleeping
on the job again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...sorry, sir.
I couldn't help it...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Never fails, does it?[A]
You just go right to sleep
whenever there's the chance.[A]
What's more, you're more troublesome
because you sleep with your eyes open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been meaning to tell you this for
a long time, but you lack discipline.[A]
I'll be checking on you regularly
from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[04B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Owww!?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Uh... General Zealot?
Yawn...[A]
Good morning, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck...[A]
There are rumors going around
in the army about you.[A]
They say that the Ilian Knight Treck
is swinging his sword in his sleep![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have yet to accomplish that,
sir.[A]
...But that does seem like fun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Treck, you've got talent.
Why don't you do your job properly?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are members of the proud
Ilian Mercenary Knights.[A]
This is a battle that will determine
the world's fate...[A]
And to us, that isn't all.[A]
The reputation of the Ilian Mercenary
Knights will be determined by our[A]
actions and how we fight in this
battle.[A]
That shall have a great impact
on the future of Ilia, and thus...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[04B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck, are you awake?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're actually awake?
What a pleasant surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I have my moments,
too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
Treck...
You've done well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We couldn't have come this far
without you.[A]
It is all thanks to you.[A]
You can sleep as much as you
want from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
...Treck![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131]
[OpenMidLeft]You were sleeping again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Eh?
General Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How many times do I have
to tell you?[A]
You should be more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Good morning, sir.[A]
[04B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can drive a ship, right?
I want to ask a favor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]From me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
We're planning on building
a new village on the Western Isles.[A]
What I want you to do is use your
ship to carry the people there.[A]
I'll pay you well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A ship, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?
You can drive one, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, I sure can.[A]
I was once the captain of a
trading vessel.[A]
There's no ocean I haven't
seen yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then why did you become
a pirate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't continue my business
in this war.[A]
We had no choice, so I persuaded
the boys saying that we were[A]
going to be pirates.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But we were originally just
ordinary seafarers.[A]
We don't like fighting or robbing
or any of that stuff.[A]
Anyway, when we were prepared and
finally set off as pirates,[A]
everyone started complaining of
stomach aches and seasickness[A]
and everything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, well.
It's amazing you got this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well, I wasn't doing
it because I liked it...[A]
[04B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even if I say we were pirates,
we were just amateurs.[A]
...We figured we'd go for easy targets
first, so we picked a small trading[A]
ship for our first one.[A]
We were able to take over most of
most of the ship without a fight,[A]
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We couldn't find any treasure
at all.[A]
The captain of the ship told me that he
was in the same situation that I was.[A]
He said that he wasn't doing well
either, so he might have to resort[A]
to piracy as well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We let them go.[A]
I couldn't steal from them
after hearing that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A nice pirate, eh?
How ever would you survive?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, that's what I thought, too.[A]
So anyway, we decided to go after
a bigger ship next.[A]
We figured we could steal from
the rich and no one would be hurt.[A]
A few days later, we were lucky
enough to come across a large[A]
trading vessel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't have to hold back
this time.[A]
We charged the ship... but when
we got close, suddenly the enemy[A]
ship started swarming with ballistaes
and archers.
It was one of Bern's battleships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My, my.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We were shot at mercilessly, and
they chased us for 3 days and nights.[A]
We somehow got away, but the
ship was wrecked.[A]
We weren't making any money, either.
Some of the boys started crying.[A]
Hell, even I felt like crying at
that time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Poor thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well like I said, I wasn't
doing it because I liked it...[A]
[04B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
What's that?
A map?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's the one trophy that
I've gotten so far as a pirate.[A]
I found it when we were
battling another band.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See the skull mark here?[A]
It means there's treasure buried
there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And did you find it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't have any money left.[A]
Once this war ends, I'll be
a merchant again.[A]
If what this map says is true, I
can go get the treasure and[A]
[ToggleSmile]travel the seas once again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't have any money left.[A]
I even went into debt to feed
the guys.[A]
It this map's a fake, then I'll
have to let go of my ship forever.[A]
...I can't help but hesitate when
I think of that possibility.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh huh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But you know that no amount of praying
and worrying is gonna get you that[A]
treasure, right?[A]
You have to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.
You're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even if that map's a fake, there'll
be other treasures out there.[A]
Anyway, you're helping us out by
carrying the residents to our new[A]
village, right?[A]
I'm counting on you.
Show me your ship sometime.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You got it.
You can count on me.[A]
[04B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]Lilina, is your magic
improving?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I think I've been getting
better since you taught me[A]
those basics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
You have a special gift for
magic, Lilina.[A]
If you practice, you'll become
a great mage like no other.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
So make sure you keep up with
your training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[04B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Cecilia, why didn't you
teach magic to Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When Roy was studying in Ostia,
you wouldn't teach him magic at[A]
all, no matter how much he asked.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah... You're right.
I didn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why didn't you?[A]
You taught it to me a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's partly because of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
Roy... you know how he is.[A]
If I taught him magic, he would have
practiced and practiced to master it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.[A]
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through mere training.[A]
What would Roy think if there was
a person with that talent right[A]
near him?[A]
He's working as hard...[A]
No, probably even harder than
that person, but he's still[A]
lagging far behind.[A]
What would he feel like?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That person...
Is it me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People have things that they're
naturally good at.[A]
It was clear that Roy wouldn't do
very well with magic, so I figured[A]
that he would be better off mastering
the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Lilina, you will eventually lead
Ostia's future.[A]
Remember this...[A]
If you assign someone to a task that
he is naturally not good at, he will[A]
waste his ability.[A]
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[04B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, don't you think
Roy changed recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In what way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He's gotten calmer...[A]
Or rather, he's more confident when
he's giving commands to the army.[A]
You would naturally become like that if
you were in charge of an entire army.[A]
If Roy didn't grow, the army itself
would be in danger.[A]General Cecilia, you said the other
day that I would be leading Ostia's[A]
future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
After all, you are Lord Hector's
only heir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think I could be
like Roy?[A]
I mean...[A]
I couldn't even recognize a
Traitor in my own castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People grow according to their
potential.[A]
Even me, I didn't know what I would
do when I was pulled from Ostia to[A]
Aquleia and was told that I would
be Etruria's Sorcery General.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you were able to
succeed because of your ability..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not true.[A]
I was only able to come this far
thanks to Percival and Lord Douglas.[A]
You're thinking that you have to do
everything on your own, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even Roy isn't fighting on his own,
you know.[A]
He's putting faith in the people
around him.[A]
That is another important attribute
for a person in power.[A]
So you can depend on people when
you want to, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I'll be glad to offer
you help when you need it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]

After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.[A]
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... The former king never did
anything after that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's[A]
mother as traitors.[A]
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.[A]
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.[A]
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.[A]
At that moment, Zephiel rose up from
the coffin and...with his sword...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was but a child then, so
naturally I could not have[A]
understood what was going on.[A]
All I knew is that after our father 
died, Zephiel never smiled again.[A]
Until then, he was strict at times,
but always a kind and loving brother[A]
to me. So...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So from that moment forward,
I knew I had to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I... see...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... But now Zephiel is at a place
where he can never hear me.[A]
Roy, please...
Please stop him.[A]
Please stop him from inflicting
pain and suffering to the people[A]
of Bern and the people of other
of other nations.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if it may resolve to
the blade?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have made my resolve when
I entrusted this task to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
You have my word and loyalty,
Princess Guinevere.[A]
I swear to the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Still, I would not be able to create
actual things like the Dark Dragon can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you found Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
I found Zephiel and asked him,
'Why did you break the Dark Dragon's[A]
seal?'[A]
Zephiel was an odd man.[A]
He didn't seem to be the least bit
surprised.[A]
He looked me right back in the eye
and asked me who I was.[A]
After I told him that I was a Dragon,
he started to smile mysteriously.[A]
He then said,
'My intentions are to give the[A]
the world to your kind.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I cannot say that I fully trusted him,
but he was still the Dark Dragon's[A]
new master, so I decided to work
with him.[A]
Zephiel then ordered the Dark Dragon to
lead the world in the place of foolish[A]
humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Zephiel is dead.
What is the Dark Dragon doing now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Although he is gone,
the Dark Dragon resides in the[A]
chamber behind me.[A]
She is waiting for the chance
to free the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But her master is gone!
Are you her new master?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did not need to become her master.[A]
She was commanded to carry out
Zephiel's orders even if he were[A]
to die.[A]
Idoun has absolute obedience to
her master.[A]
She will make sure that humans are
banished from this land.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
Her heart was destroyed,
and now she's bound to orders[A]
given by a person long dead?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you feel pity, like Hartmut
did?[A]
...You humans are truly difficult
to understand.[A]
But let me tell you this.[A]
No matter how hard you try, humans
and Dragons will never be able to[A]
live in harmony.[A]
The gap between species is
impossible to fill.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not true![A]
I know a place where Dragons and humans
are living together.[A]
Dragons and humans were both brought
into the same world.[A]
They can, and will, understand each
other![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dragons and humans,
living together in harmony?[A]
Rubbish.[A]
I have no intention of
listening to such nonsense.[A]
Now, enter my domain.

[OpenMidRight]It didn't die?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, apparently the sword reacted to
its wielder's feelings and changed its[A]
power accordingly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So Hartmut didn't want to kill
it, so the Sword of Seals[A]
reacted to his emotions and only[A]
knocked the Dark Dragon unconscious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that Hartmut did know a
little bit about the Dark Dragon.[A]
And then seeing her as the little girl
Idoun, he must have felt pity for her.[A]
It is another emotion that we Dragons
cannot comprehend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pity...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And thus at the bottom of his heart
he didn't want to kill her.[A]
In my opinion, I would never leave something
that would be a danger to me alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So Hartmut's heart
changed the sword's strength...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hartmut persuaded his comrades and decided
to seal the Dark Dragon.[A]
He built a temple deep in the forests of
Bern and sealed Idoun away using the[A]
sword and a gemstone.[A]
They are what you call the Sword of
Seals and the Fire Emblem.[A]
He then created a nation near the temple
that would watch over and protect the seal[A]
from being broken.[A]
They are the ancestors of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How do you know all this?
Were you watching?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
I had been deeply wounded, so I was
leading a hidden life healing myself.[A]
I heard the story about the seal
from Zephiel.[A]
Although he said that he read it in
the ancient scrolls that are kept in[A]
the court library.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How did you meet Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]With him?[A]

you came to aid us in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That event was an exception
because Percival worked with me.[A]
But now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry yourself..[A]
We can return to Lycia when we
complete this mission anyway.[A]
But may I ask you to take care
of Lycia while we are away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
You can leave the Lycia Alliance, and
also Princess Guinevere, to me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]Roy...
I may not go with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The battles on these islands
are likely to become slugfests.[A]
You can never know what
will happen.[A]
I think you should hide in Etruria
with protection from General Cecilia.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x134]Your Highness, please trust me.
I understand your intentions of[A]
suggesting a truce, and I also promised
Roy that I would protect you.[A]
Trust me, I will defend
you at all costs.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...I understand.
I apologize for being selfish.[A]
Roy, I pray
for your safety.[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What!?
Then Lycia would be in danger![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]M-Master Roy![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Your country could be in peril.[A]
Are you sure you want to be wasting
your time on a little island like this?[A]
[OpenFarRight]He's right![A]
If Bern wanted us to get away from
Lycia so they could invade,[A]
then we must go back at once...[A]
[OpenRight]...I'm not going back.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What!? Why!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Right now, it's very difficult
to judge what information[A]
is true and what is false.[A]
In times like this, the worst thing
to do is to jump to information[A]
presented in front of you and taking
action based on it.[A]
Sure, I'm worried about Lycia,
but my father is there, and[A]
General Cecilia is also watching
over Lycia.[A]
But only our army is on these islands.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That's true, but...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]If we just leave without fully
clearing out the bandits,[A]
then what we did so far
would all be a lie...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...I see you are blessed
with a wise leader.[A]
[OpenRight]What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy,
I am so sorry I tried you so.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tried us!?
So what you said was a lie!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I have not lied.[A]
But I did present the rumor in such
a way that you would easily[A]
jump onto it.[A]
But Master Roy kept his head.[A]
I feel that I would like to join
an individual like you.[A]
Master Roy,
please count me among your ranks.[A]
[OpenRight]...I don't like the idea that
you were testing us, but if[A]
[ToggleSmile]you're willing to help,
then we'll welcome you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes,
please fight alongside us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then,
back to business.[A]
What can we do to help the
people on these isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Head south...
towards Caledonia.[A]
[OpenRight]Why?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Castle Idina is located there,
where the people being sent[A]
to Mt.Ebrakhm are kept.[A]
[OpenRight]All right,
then let's save those people first![A][......]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy,
please take this sword.[A]
[OpenRight]What is this?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]It is a sword called the
Wyrmslayer.[A]
I hear it was created during the
Scouring to use against Dragons.[A]
[OpenRight]Wyrmslayer?[A]
This isn't a Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]No.[A]
The Divine Weapons can only be used
by those who have skill equal to the[A]
Eight Heroes.[A]
But this weapon should be useable[A]
by people of this army as well.[A]

[OpenMidRight]It can make more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon can make more of
its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now, that being said...[A]
I want to learn more about the Dragons.
Let me accompany your travels.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I wield Dark Magic...
I'm sure I can be of some assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A][Clear]
We want to learn about the Dragons
as well.[A]
It may be dangerous, but if that's
okay with you, you're welcome to[A]
join us.[A]
[07CA]

[07CB]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Then they should be
powerful allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes!
Fortune is still with us,[A]
Master Roy![A]
But...
I heard from the mercenary[A]
knights that one of the Three
Dragon Lords is coming here[A]
with a legion of Dragon Knights.[A]
If they should join the rebels,
then our chances of defeating them[A]
would become extremely slim.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy... what are you going to do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Kingdom of Etruria
might join us.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Etruria?!
Would that be possible?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]General Cecilia, the Sorcery General of
Etruria was my teacher in battle arts[A]
while I was studying in Ostia.[A]
I have a feeling that she would be
willing to join forces with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would object, Master Roy![A]
If we depend on Etruria to solve our
own matters in Lycia, we'll be[A]
sure to be their laughing
stock for decades![A]
[OpenRight]Yes, I know that...[A]
But this is truly an important
matter for Lycia.[A]
I think that we should go
for the safest and most[A]
definite option rather than
worry about the[A]
consequences and do nothing,
which would most likely[A]
lead to the extinction of Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Master Roy.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to move quickly!
I'll write a letter to General Cecilia.[A]
Merlinus, I need you to get the letter
to her as quickly as possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, Master Roy!
You are right.[A]
I shall send the letter to her[A]
as soon as you are ready.[A]
[OpenRight]Thanks.[A]
All right, everybody!
Let's retake Ostia![A]

What can we do to help the[A]
people of the isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We must go to Djuto.
The Etrurian capital is there.[A]
We must crush it to fully
liberate the people.[A]
[OpenRight]All right!
We're going to Djuto![A]
We will fight for the people living
there, and defeat our true enemy![A]

had no reason to attack Bern as they
had not suffered a direct offense.[A]
[0941]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at the Capital of Aquleia,[A]
[0942]
and the Lycia Alliance Army was to be
an independent squad under the Etrurian[A]
[0943]
military. To test his worth, Etruria
sent Roy to the Western Isles, where[A]
[0944]
his mission was to rid the islands of
the bandits terrorizing the people.[A]
[0945]
The Western Isles is an archipelago
under Etrurian protection lying to[A]
[0946]
the west of the mainland. Many
mining corporations have sprouted up[A]
[0947]
trying to monopolize the rich minerals
that lie in the islands' soil. However,[A]
the riches attracted many bandits, and the
people lived in constant fear of them...[A]
[0948]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you not found that bard
of the resistance force?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We are still searching
for him, my lord.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]And?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It appears he has hidden
himself in a village on the[A]
outskirts of the castle...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The resistance group is
just another band without[A]
that Elphin supporting them
with his brains.[A]
I don't care what happens to
the village, just find him![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, my lord.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, I apologize for keeping
you waiting, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You seemed...
busy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh no, we prioritize allying
with Bern above all things.[A]
So if you need anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Then, as I asked earlier...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, the whereabouts
of Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you have any
information, Lord Zinc?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I regret to say
that I do not.[A]
You have already visited
the capital at Djuto?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then I suggest you pay
a visit to Bishop Oro.[A]
He resides in the castle,[A]
overlooking Mt. Ebrakhm to the north.
He knows this region better than any[A]
of us, so I would believe he'd have
some ideas.[A]
However, if even he does not know
where Princess Guinevere is, then[A]
I would think she is not on these
islands.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
I will talk with
Bishop Oro.[A]
Thank you
for your time.[A]
[ClearFace]
[0949]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The rebel group is supposed
to be very active in these areas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, according to
our sources.[A]
But I also understand that earlier
this week, the resistance[A]
group was hunted down by
Etruria's military.[A]
I heard that they were
devastated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The Etrurian government lets
the bandits go and opresses[A]
the resistance group who are
trying to help the people.[A]
It doesn't look good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it does not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Could we do anything
to help?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be difficult..[A]
We would be going against
Etruria's nobility.[A]
I don't think that would be
a good idea when we are working[A]
under Etruria's orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll send a messenger to
General Cecilia and see what[A]
she has to say.[A]
We probably shouldn't do anything
too risky right now, but...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy![A]
Lord Zinc who controls this area
is sending out troops to attack[A]
the villages to find a member
of the resistance force![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]What!
...Should we?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We don't have time to wait
for General Cecilia's reply...[A]
But I want to help the people.[A]
...Even if it means going
against Etruria's orders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's fight![A]
So we can be proud
when we return to Lycia![A]
[094A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x136][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, were you able to find out
where Princess Guinevere is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
But I heard a bishop named Oro
in charge of the mines in the north[A]
might know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]All right,
then let's head north.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Gale... I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the case
on Guinevere in secercy, so he only[A]
assigned my group to look for her.[A]
I'm sorry I got you mixed up into
this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of the captains
working directly under General Murdock.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Murdock has agreed to my helping
you out.[A]
In fact, he wants me to find out the
location of the Princess and the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think that Princess
Guinevere has the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that's the what the
royalty thinks.[A]
And I think they're correct,
looking at the situation.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Come on,
don't look like that...[A]
Probably Princess Guinevere
has a plan of some sort.[A]
Come, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes...[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Where...am I..?[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...What...happened...
to me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]We found you lying at the
entrance of the village, all[A]
brusied and blood-splattered.[A]
So we brought you home and
treated your wounds.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]And you are...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm Mary.
I live here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Live here...[......]No![A]
This village will be
endangered if I stay here..[A]
...Or maybe it's too late
if it's already been one day..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am Elphin...
One of the resistance group.[A]
The landowner is sure to send
troops here to capture me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The resistance group...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Miss Mary,
you should run from here.[A]
This village is in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...No,
I will stay.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have a younger brother.[A]
Right now he's gone out to look
for work with his friend from[A]
next door.[A]
His friend asked me to take
care of his younger sister[A]
while they was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Then all I can do to protect
this village is leave.[A]
Thank you very much
for healing my wounds.[A]
Please take care.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, you take
care too.[A]
[094C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is the matter?[A]
Why is taking so long to find one
resistance group member?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
They are fighting to protect
the villagers...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Alliance Army?[A]
They would go against Etruria?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]We have gotten a message from Djuto.
It says,[A]
"The Lycia Alliance Army is suspected
to be working with the bandits.[A]
Capture them, or kill them,
if necessary."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?
Tied in with the bandits?[A]
How ironic![A]
So they want to kill them to
save their own skins...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is not the mainland.
Might makes right here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not quite sure
I understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry about it then.[A]
Is that all they said from
Djuto?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Lord Arcard has provided
us with reinforcements.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
[OpenMidLeft]They should be arriving soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Damn![A]
Even if we defeat the Lycia
Alliance Army, we will not[A]
get all the credit if we are
aided by reinforcements![A]
We need to do this quickly..[A]
Ah, of course!
Get Scollan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x151]Yeah?[A]
What can I do for you,
Master Zinc?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I want you to burn down
all the villages in this area.[A]
Kill the villagers as well.[A]
[OpenLeft]...What if there's
treasure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do with it as you wish.
Just hurry.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Got it, Master Zinc.
Hehehehe...[A]

Where's Gonzales![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F]Here...

[OpenMidRight]There's a village to the south.
You got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Get it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That might be a hidden base
for the resistance forces.[A]
Master Zinc says to burn it down,
village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Right.
Now git![A]
A stupid hulk like you only comes in

You better not screw up.[A]

[OpenMidRight]You got a problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Heh, he looks like hell,

He shouldn't be scared of
busting up one tiny village.[A][Clear]

you got that too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss![A]
[094E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][ToggleSmile]So that's the
Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128]They're supposed to be fighting
against the bandits...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
But Lord Arcard says that they
are fighting with the bandits[A]
to attack the villagers.[A]
Why are they doing the opposite
of what they were told to do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft].....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate, can you take your troops and
attack from the north?[A]
I'll start attacking from here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Tate!
Wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see that you have some
siblings.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I have two sistersア
one older, one younger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are they all Pegasus Knights
like yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, actually, I have a
younger sister myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She must be very beautiful
if she is your sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.
And yes, she is pretty.[A]
But I've heard she got tangled
up in some mess and I don't know[A]
where she is now..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Oh my..[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've sent out some people to look
but they haven't found her yet.[A]
If only I wasn't on this mission,
I could go look myself..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]

For your family's sake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,[.....]
thank you.[A]
[094F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir, are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Arcard said to leave most
of the fighting up to Ilia's[A]
Pegasus Knights so that we
the Etrurian army, suffer the[A]
least casulaties.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Don't be ridiculous,
they are trustworthy companions.[A]
We will attack at the same time...
or even before them.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Still, Lord Arcard's story
is strange..[A]
The army from Lycia just got here.[A]
...Would they get tied in with
the bandits so quickly...?[A]
[0950]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x153]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you ready?
We're going to move southward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Captain...
Are you sure we'll be all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps the Etrurian army means
to use us up front as disposables..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who says that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]One of our group members heard rumors
like that in the Etrurian army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you take rumors seriously all the
time, you won't be able to do anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Besides, if that were true,
General Klein wouldn't approve of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Klein's not like that.
I trust him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alright.[A]
Then we'll trust him as well,
for we trust you, Captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks.
Let's go![A]
[0951]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Zinc, the reinforcements from
Djuto should be arriving shortly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Damn![A]
We're having enough trouble
as it is...[A]
I don't need any reinforcements
to take all the credit![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Additional reinforcements

[OpenMidLeft]Let the people escape.
I take order, I destroy village.[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What?
Don't![A]
The people living in the
village are innocent...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]No.

[OpenMidRight]I have no such intention.[A]
I heard that you were the ones

We just want things cleaned up

Since you have turned your back

[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry.
I just couldn't wait to see you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The things you would do...[A]
Well, you're safe and that's

As long as we can find our leader,

Just because those rebel idiots[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No! That's not the case![A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Don't lie... You're going to war.
There's no saying you'll return.[A]

Without false hope...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a magic weapon that

A few months ago, my granddaughter
went missing. The villagers searched[A]
the mountains for her,[A]
and when they found her,
she was with a huge monster of a man.[A]
We threw stones at him and drove him off...
But my granddaughter told me that[A]
he found her crying and led her to
the village. ..If you see that man,[A]
would you give him this?[A]
It's a special axe that's effective
against swords.[A]
And...

[0966]
[LoadFace][0x14D]The people are suffering...?[.....]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let him pass.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]Ah, so you are Roy?[A]
Pleased to meet you,
my name is Elphin.[A]
I am a member of the[A]
resistance forces here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My thanks for saving our
village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, we simply did
what we thought was right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.[A]
Certainly you had thought of that
before you took action?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so,
we did what we felt was right.[A]
Although this is a sign of rebellion[A]
against Etruria, if the truth about
these islands is made public, they[A]
will understand.
I have sent a letter to a[A]
trustworthy member of the Etrurian
Nobility.[A]
If she takes the appropriate[A]
measures, I think we can tip the
tables in our favor.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not be so sure of that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Did you ever think it strange
that Etruria sent you in to[A]
rid of the bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually yes... of course.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]This is merely my theory...[A]
But I believe that the ones who
requested your help are[A]
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How do you know that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Why did those two have to
get your army off the mainland?[A]
Could there be some kind of problem
if you had stayed in Lycia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
I never thought of it
from that perspective...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There are rumors...[A]
That Roartz and Arcard are
actually tied in with Bern.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you this this

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I wanted to thank you[A]
for protecting our village.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
I just did what I thought was right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please take this as
a token of our gratitude.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1DC][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D]
[OpenMidLeft]General Klein,[A]
we will stay here and reconstruct
the area, as you directed us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]We wish we could fight
alongside you.[A]
Oh, and here is the arrow you

I will give it back to you.[A]
Farewell and good luck, General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]

We will return to Ilia

[OpenMidRight]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, and this...[A]
Your sister gave it to me

Please be careful...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.
You be careful too.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x187][ToggleSmile]Hurry!
Over here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x189]A-Are you sure?
If we get caught...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You idiot![A]
If we stay there, we have no
choice but to work and work[A]
until we die![A]
You're going to put up with
that?[A]
Don't you have family or
something back home?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If we escape toward the northeast,
there are some people who can help us.[A]
We've got to get there![A]
[096D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x146][ToggleSmile]What!
Some more people escaped!?[A]
[MoveMidRight]What were the guards doing![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14F]Somebody put sleeping
drugs in their food...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That means there is someone
among our ranks who is taking[A]
contact with the enemy.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Morgan![OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1DD][A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to pursue and
capture those who have escaped.[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes, my lord.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I will return to the capital at Djuto.
Don't let them escape.[A]
Also keep sending workhands to the mines.
I can't afford to lose that mine now![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin,
that castle to the southwest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
that is Castle Idina.[A]
The people captured on this island[A]
are first sent there before they
are ported to Mt. Ebrakhm.[A]
Today just happens to be the day
that the captives are sent to the[A]
mines on a weekly basis.[A]
Rescuing them will be difficult if
we have to go all to the mines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must rescue
them now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I have already sent some spies
to sneak into the castle to help[A]
the people escape.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How will they release
the captives?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have told them to send the
captives to the northeast.[A]
In other words, here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must first rescue those
people before attacking the castle.[A]
[0970]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x189][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So the people living on this
island are captured in that castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well then, let's go rescue
them, shall we?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry.[A]
I know you were looking for your
daughter, and we made you help[A]
us out like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you guys helped me,
so I should help you, too.[A]
Besides, a real man wouldn't look at
people suffering due to their marquess'[A]
greed and simply ignore them.[A]
[0971]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1DD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Morgan,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
Send them out immediately.[A]
Send them from the back so that they
can defend the castle even if we[A]
should be surrounded.[A]

I have made up my mind.[A]
I want to become a great

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I understand.
I don't mean to drag you home.[A]
In fact, I want to assist you

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Assist me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Well, I know that there are a lot of
hardships during a journey of training.[A]
So I can help you out
in tough situations...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Would you not be able to train your
sword skills with your father around?[A]
Or do you not understand your Father's
love for worrying about you like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]No!
That's not it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well then,
we understand each other.[A]
But first we must capture that castle.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Sigh....[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even though we've captured Castle Idina
and released the people here, it doesn't[A]
mean we've rescued all the people
living on these isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
To fully liberate the Western Isles,
we must get rid of the Etrurian[A]
capital.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So we must head for Djuto.[A]
...Elphin,
may I ask you something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Correct me if I'm wrong.[A]
But are you not someone of
high Etrurian nobility?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!![A][Clear]
...What makes you think that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
I can't really explain it, but...[A]
For example, the way you talk
sounds very educated.[A]
In Ostia, I learned how to 'study'
people and to make estimates about[A]
them.[A]
Anyway, am I right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What would you do if I
were what you think I am?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
No, I wouldn't do anything
in particular.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You must have some reason
to hide your identity.[A]
You can tell me when you
feel comfortable about it.[A]
Okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go to Djuto![A]

W-Wait![A]
This is too close to Aquleia.
The enemy is already too close![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what you must do is
defeat them.[A]
This is a good place to set up
defenses because the enemy will[A]
most surely attack here because
it is so close to the capital.[A]
We can be most prepared here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Well,

attack our village?[A]
I see...
I must thank you for[A]
informing us.
Please take this.[A]
[0981]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17D]
I hear there's a village
far to the northeast.[A]
It's too far from here,
so nobody's ever seen it,[A]
but I wonder if anyone's
living there?[A]
[0982]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x177]
I saw a strange person
in Bern's ranks.[A]
Probably a thief.[A]
I think you should tell the
villagers before they get robbed.[A]

[LoadFace][0x146][ToggleSmile]W-Why![A]
Why is this happening
to me?![A]

[OpenFarRight][SendToBack][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcard...[A]
What a pathetic ending for one
who became so powerful.[A]
[OpenRight][SendToBack]Well, last year I didn't think
we would be doing this either.[A]
Maybe fate can turn out in the
most unlikely way...[A]
And that might be true for Bern
also...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]...?[A]
Master Roy, what is that
you are holding in your hand?[A]
[OpenRight]Oh, this?
This is the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...
So this tiny gem...[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinevere wanted me
to keep it.[A]
It seemed...[A]
difficult for her to give it
to me...[A]
She must have been hoping to
end the war peacefully until[A]
there was no hope left...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm...
Trust between siblings?[A]
It didn't seem likely on
the outside.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy is Zephiel,
king of Bern![A]
It is said that he murdered his own
he father, so I didn't think that[A]
would be moved by family trust...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
He killed his own father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Didn't you know,
Master Roy?[A]
Zephiel took the throne because the
former king had died.[A]
But because the former king's death
had been so sudden, there are[A]
many rumors going around.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And one of them is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...That Zephiel assassinated him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinevere know
about this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She must know something about
it, if not at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0986]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CD][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian army has appeared
from the west.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
Draw them into our territory as
planned.[A]
We shall show them our strength.
Have the other clans been notified?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Although there are many clans who
are expressing their discontent[A]
toward our alliance with Bern, further
invasion by Etrurian forces seem[A]
to require more attention.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
...The Etrurian army should be
easier to deal with than that[A]
"Silver Wolf" since the Etrurian
army is an invasion force.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The clans will unite to fight
against invaders...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
That is the law of Sacae.[A]
When we were up against the Silver Wolf,
no one aided us because they saw it[A]
as a conflict between clans.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But now we have Bern behind
us, so we need not any help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly.[A]
Then of course, there are many
who don't like the idea that[A]
it is Bern who has actual
control of Sacae's politics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I hear there are many clans
who agree with the Silver Wolf's[A]
guerilla tactics and joined
forces with him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He is stubborn.[A]
His clan was defeated, so he
should join us.[A]
It is not as if he doesn't know
what happens to those who try and[A]
fight a head-on battle with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even large cities like Bulgar have
been attacked and taken over by Bern[A]
since they resisted.[A]
[OpenMidRight]From now on, those who are strong
enough to manipulate the situation[A]
around them will survive, like us.
And right now, we must use the law[A]
of Sacae to do so.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere...
We are getting close to Bern's army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since we are getting closer, we
are clashing with soldiers from Bern[A]
more and more often.[A]
It will not be long until we engage
in full combat with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish to ask you something
before we do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have been hearing rumors...
that King Zephiel rose to the throne[A]
because he killed his father, the
former king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]I could not believe it.[A]
You tried to stop him even by casting
away your nationality.[A]
If King Zephiel is such a mad individual
as the rumors say, then you would not of[A]
thought of doing what you did.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinevere,[A]
I accepted the Fire Emblem not
to use it in battle, but to[A]
try and find a use for it
to end this war peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Therefore, please tell me
the truth about the rumors...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That was no easy feat.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But now we have hit our strongest

Although I'm sure that there are
remaining forces somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They must be meeting
to plan a retaliation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can we find out where
they are meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I sent a spy out earlier,
so he should be returning soon.[A]
I will go check.[A][ClearFace][.......][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,
Princess Guinevere?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I have come to speak
about my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
...Is it all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I want you to know before we
enter Bern...about the tragedies[A]
that have occurred.[A]
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In short...[.....]
it is true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
He didn't kill his father
to get the throne?[A]
[OpenLeft]No...[A]
Our father was the first
one who tried to kill Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He...couldn't bear the abuse he
was taking from our father.[A]
And so he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...
Why did....[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154]...Master Roy![A]
We have found where the
enemy is meeting![A]
...?
What is the matter?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]No...it is nothing.
Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...Did I appear at a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's okay.
Where is the meeting place?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]It is in a city called Bulgar.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bulgar...
I've heard of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is the largest city in Sacae.[A]
Although, now it has been taken
down by Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
All right, we'll be
heading there soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][Clear]...Why did the former king
try to murder his own son?[A]
[0993]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13D][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They're here...!
And so quickly...[A]
Could they not have given me
the time to set up defenses![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14E]We will try and stop the enemy
from progressing any further.[A]
You can retreat to the palace
and fortify your defenses there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Can you hold them back?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We must at least try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]If you do not know whether
you can win or not...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then what would you do?
Flee?[A]
Tell me, just where do
think you can hide?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Brenya has given me
orders to protect you.[A]
And I will do so with all my
strength![A]
But you must not be afraid to
fight either![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A-All right...[A]
Then I shall fortify the inside
and leave the outside to you.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]...That is the highest advisor
of the Etrurian council?[A]
Why should we fight for him at
all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't say that.[A][Clear]
General Brenya didn't willingly tell
us to protect him.[A]
She had no choice because Etruria
joined forces with Bern.[A]
Therefore, we must fulfill our
our duties as warriors.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I have also gotten hold of
information that allies of the Silver[A]
Wolf are lurking around here.[A]
Keep on guard at all times.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[0994]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am sorry that I cannot find
the time to talk with you at[A]
leisure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is all right.[A]
...My brother started this in the
first place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]May I ask the reason why
Bern's former king tried[A]
to murder King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
It was an arranged marrige to strengthen
the tie between Bern and Etruria.[A]
However, our father already had a woman
he loved at that time.[A]
She was my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The marriage between our father
and Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Therefore, our father didn't love
Zephiel's mother and always[A]
thought badly of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then is that why the former king
and King Zephiel had a bad relationship?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.[A]
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.[A]
He grew to become a proud heir to
Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the king try to...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Master Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]All right,
I'll be there in a minute![A][Clear]
Princess Guinevere,
I am sorry, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is all right.
Please be careful.[A]
[0995]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x124][ToggleSmile]Well well...
So it has started.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x107]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x17B]Just when we thought Bern had
finished invading, now we[A]
have to deal with Etruria.
Sigh.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Small wonder.
This is a large trading city.[A]
Any army would want control of it.[.....]
Well then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]H-Hey wait,
where are you going?[A]
[OpenRight]I'm going to watch the fight.
Let us see how good that Roy is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What, now?
But...[A]
[OpenRight]Don't you worry about me.
Everything will be fine.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]What? Hey wait!
You're leaving too?[A]
[0996]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14E]The reinforcements should be
arriving soon...[A]
I want you to[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidLeft]open the front gate to
let the reinforcements in when[A]
they arrive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir.[A]
[0997]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft]Tell the troops to start attacking the
guerilla forces hiding in the houses.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir.[A]
[0998]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]All right, they should be here soon...
Open the gate![A]
[0999]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17B]
I was selling weapons to Bern
before the war...[A]
But now that they've taken
over the city,[A]
They won't pay me anything!
Here, I'll give you this[A][Clear]
Dragon-killing sword,
so can you do something?[A]
I've been hiding it from them...
You know why...don't you?[A]
[099A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x179]
Would you like a magic
ring from Etruria?[A]
People used to buy them before,
but I had to close my shop[A]
because of the war.
Here, take one...[A]
They won't sell anyway.[A]
[099B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17D]
This goddess statue[A]
brings good luck.
Well, I used to say that[A]
to trick people,
but I can't do business[A]
with the war going on.
Here, take one.[A]
It won't bring you any luck, though.[A]
[099C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17F]
Phew...[.....]
I found this,[A]
so I'm not stealing it!
I'm sure I can sell it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa!
A-Are you from Bern?[A]
No, I wasn't stealing
this sword![A]
See ya![A]
[099D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17E]
This is a Longbow,
a favorite of Sacae clans.[A]
Here, take one.
Use it to drive Bern's[A]
soldiers out of here![A]

This...is inevitable.[A]
[09A0]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]

You're not too bad,

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Who are you!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152]What!?
Hey![A]
I said you couldn't come in.
Master Roy is very busy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]She kept pestering me that
she wanted to see you.[A]
But you were busy so I
was trying to drive her away.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Listen to me first.[A]
Then you can decided whether to want
to get rid of me or not.[A]
I think I have some information that
you might be interested in.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What is that?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]It is about the beasts
who change form into humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight][......][ToggleSmile]...I want to speak
with her in private.[A]
Can you leave the room?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Well well, that got you
interested, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those beasts you speak of...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right. Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Dragons you speak of...[A]
They are not the Wyverns that Bern's
Dragon Knights use, but the strange[A]
troops that are mixed in with
Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
Those are the Dragons that
were supposedly defeated[A]
in the Dragon Human wars.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Niime.[A]
I study ancient Dark Magic in the mountains,
so some call me the Hermit on the Mountain.[A]
This war...at first I thought it was just
another battle so I didn't pay heed to it.[A]
But now I can feel the evil among Bern's
troops, so I investigated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And did you find
out anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only decipher[A]
so many of them.[A]
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dark Dragon...[A]
That is the leader of the
Dragons that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dragons are simply a much more advanced
species than humans.[A]
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.[A]
However, there was one thing that the
Dragons lagged far behind the humans in.[A]
The Dragons' reproductive system was
much less efficient than that of the[A]
humans.[A]
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had the power to create more Dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from my research.[A]
[09A1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][ToggleSmile]They allowed them to get in to
the palace!?[A]
[MoveMidRight]Blast![A]
If I go to hell, then that Roy
shall be going down with me![A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Lord Roartz![A]
The remainders of the Djute Clan are
saying that they'll come to our aid[A]
once they have securely hidden
the Mirugre.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mirugre?[.....]
Ah, one of the Divine Weapons.[A]
Good, we must hold our own until then![A]
[09A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is Roartz's manor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that this palace holds
methods of attacking through little[A]
cracks in the framework.[A]
You must not think you are safe
just because your back is to the[A]
is to the wall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know much about this
place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I am at least slightly known
to know more things than most people.[A]
The rumor about the palace is
something I picked up back in the city.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you know what the
Dark Dragon looks like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I can't say I'm absolutely sure[A]
about that.[A]
But I would love to see it with my
own eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe the Dark Dragon is in
human form as well.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A]
Maybe all the Dragons are in
human form now.[A]
I've also heard stories of Dragons in
human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know anything specific,
but I read in an ancient scroll[A]
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have heard about it,
have you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, only in legend.[A][Clear]
'At the Winter of Ends, the
laws of nature were turned[A]
upside down.[A]
Day became night, and
summer became winter.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,[A]
but one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist[A]
the planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who knows...[A]
Popular belief says that the
laws of nature were twisted when the[A]
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of
magical power, but I have no idea what[A]
really happened, either.[A]
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the[A]
Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[09A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1CE]Those pigs from Etruria...![A]
I shall avenge the Djute Clan
right here, right now![A]
[09A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107]Good,
the palace is in chaos.[A]
I shall fight those Bern troops
[ToggleSmile]alone, to the death![A]
[09A5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]So...[A]
This is Bulgar, the biggest city
in Sacae.[A]
I heard it was demolished by Bern,
but there are so many soldiers here...[A]
[ToggleSmile]There must be some treasure.[A]
[09A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you the Etrurian General
leading this group?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Dayan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dayan...?
I've heard it somewhere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must first thank you.[A]
My clan was always fighting against
Bern and the clans that followed Bern.[A]
We were forced to reside to guerrila
warfare instead of going up against[A]
them face to face.[A]
However, now that you have attacked
Bern, the tables are beginning to[A]
tip in our favor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.
I am glad that I could help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I want to ask you one thing.[A]
Once this battle is over, do you
intend to withdraw your troops[A]
right away?[A]
[OpenMidRight]After this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Sacae belongs to us Sacaean people.[A]
If authoritarian rule by Bern is only
to be replaced by Etrurian rule, then[A]
we would have to fight you next.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right after this battle...
That would not be possible.[A]
We must have Sacae as a base to
launch direct attacks on Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...
Directly into Bern's lands?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if we could drive off Bern now,
it would only be a matter of time[A]
until they strike back at us.[A]
We must destroy their roots.
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are right.
I see...[A]
In that case, I
shall aid you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That would help us tremendously.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But once Bern is defeated, you
must withdraw your troops from Sacae.[A]
Is that all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
You have my word.[A]
[09A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandpa...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue!?
You were all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was rescued by this army.[A]
But I was the only one of our
of our clansmen who survived...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand...
It was a hard battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grandpa, come with us.
This army wouldn't invade Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I swear to the sky and earth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.
I shall take your word for it.[A]

Men and Dragons once lived in harmony
on this land. However, that harmony
was broken when the men suddenly
started to invade. In a great war
known later as the Scouring, both
sides fought over dominion of the
continent. The laws of nature were
twisted from the vast amounts of
power that were released...
The Dragons were defeated and
disappeared from the face of continent.
Mankind then began to spread its
forces throughout to populate the land.
And now, 1000 years later...

[0A72]
The Scouring...
The great war between Dragons and men...[A]
[0A73]
The Dragons were defeated
and disappeared from Elibe...[A]
[0A74]
Mankind celebrated victory and then
spread their forces throughout the continent...[A]
[0A75]
1000 years have passed...[A]
[0A76]
The people of the continent Elibe have
been spreading technology and civilization[A]
for some time now, after the Dragons had
been defeated in the Scouring.[A]
[0A77]
In the west resides the kingdom of
Etruria, which has the highest level of[A]
civilization in Elibe.[A]
[0A78]
The Kingdom of Bern, with a powerful
military and a practical and pragmatic[A]
attitude about life, is located in the east.[A]
[0A79]
These are the two strongest nations in Elibe,
and the lesser nations are located between[A]
them.[A]
[0A7A]
There is the Lycian Alliance, which is under
joint relationship of various marquesses.[A]
[0A7B]
The people of the Knights Union of Ilia
are hard at work cultivating the snowy[A]
wastelands in the north.[A]
[0A7C]
In Sacae live various clans which ride
through the plains on horseback.[A]
[0A7D]
Although there were occasional clashes
between nation-states, there was a general[A]
sense of balance of power and peace in
Elibe.[A]
However, that balance was suddenly
disrupted...[A]
[0A7E]
King Zephiel, ruler of the Kingdom of Bern,
has sent his forces out to conquer the rest[A]
of Elibe.[A]
[0A7F]
Bern's forces invaded Sacae and Ilia and
mercilessly massacred all those who stood[A]
against them.[A]
And now, Bern has shown signs of invading
the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[0A80]
A youth named Roy was in Lycia's largest
territory, Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He was sent as a transfer student to train
to become the next Marquess of Pherae.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood, who has fallen ill,
has sent for Roy to return home.[A]
[0A81]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Just around that time Lilina, the[LoadOverworldFaces]
daughter of Hector, had traveled to Lycia[A]
to pay her respects to Eliwood.[A]
[0A82]
After getting the message, Roy hurried
back home, taking with him his loyal[A]
knights and [LoadOverworldFaces]Bors, a knight from Ostia
responsible for Lilina's safety.[A]

[0A83]
The story begins when Roy had reached an
area on the outskirts of Pherae...[A]
[0A84]

[0A85]

[0A86]

[0A87]

[0A88]

[0A89]

[0A8A]
There is a small village on the border
of Pherae and Bern.[A]
Here was where Roy was to meet the
[LoadOverworldFaces]mercenary band that Eliwood had hired[A]
for him.[A]
[0A8B]
Just east of the village is a small castle
occupied by Bern's forces.[A]
When Roy had reached the village,
the castle was in a chaotic state.[A]
Roy had yet to learn that the confusion
going on in the castle was going to[A]
cause turbulence all over Elibe...[A]
[0A8C]

[0A8D]

[0A8E]

[0A8F]
Just to the north of Pherae territory
stands Castle Araphen.[A]
The Lycia Alliance had gathered here to
discuss the matters of going up against[A]
Bern.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy[LoadOverworldFaces] and [LoadOverworldFaces]Guinevere were only half
a day away from Castle Araphen, when a[A]
messenger brought them news that they
could not believe.[A]
The message was this:[A]
"Bern has a trio of elite generals
called the Three Dragon Lords."[A]
[0A90]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Two of these three, General Brenya and
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Narshen, have attacked Castle[A]
Araphen and nearly decimated the Lycia
Alliance Army.[A]

[0A91]
Although the morale of the Pherae Army went
down severely, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy led his group towards[A]
Castle Araphen to find survivors and
check the damage.[A]
[0A92]

[0A93]

[0A94]

[0A95]

[0A96]

[0A97]

[0A98]
Respecting Hector's last wishes,
Roy made his way west toward Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On the way there,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy passes through the Laus territory,[A]
goverened by [LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Eric.[A]
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory
with vast meadows and clear streams,[A]
but there was great skullduggery
going on behind the scenes...[A]
[0A99]
Lord Eric, Marquess of Laus, had been
working with Bern against his allies[A]
of Lycia.[A]
This gave [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy further shock.[A]
Lycia, where Roy had grown up in, was
no longer a safe place to be either.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heading for Ostia, Roy decided to move
[LoadOverworldFaces]through the mountains where people[A]
seldom want to avoid unncessary trouble.[A]
[0A9A]

[0A9B]

[0A9C]

[0A9D]

[0A9E]

[0A9F]
After taking [LoadOverworldFaces]Saul, a priest of the
Elimine Church, and [LoadOverworldFaces]Dorothy, his[A]
bodyguard into their ranks, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy
and company crossed the mountains and[A]
entered the [LoadOverworldFaces]Thria lands, located to
the southeast of Ostia.[A]
Thria is governed by Lord Orun, a
half brother to Lord Hector.[A]
[0AA0]
Orun's home castle seemed to be a safe
place to stay for Roy.[A]

[0AA1]
However, Bern had its reach in the lands
of Thria as well...[A]
[0AA2]

[0AA3]

[0AA4]

[0AA5]
Hearing of the rebellion,
Roy hurried his pace towards Ostia.[A]
[0AA6]
According to the information that he had
gathered on the way, [LoadOverworldFaces]General Leygance,[A]
one of Lord Hector's advisors, had started
a rebellion with[LoadOverworldFaces] Lieutenant Devias to sell[A]
Ostia to Bern.[A]
[0AA7]
Lilina had been captured and taken hostage
by Leygance. She was then imprisoned inside[A]
Castle Ostia, because Leygance thought
that he could use her for something[A]
later on.[A]
[0AA8]
Hearing that report, Roy and company
entered Ostia in an effort to[A]
rescue Lilina.[A]
[0AA9]
Ostia, the largest and most active city in
Lycia, was to become a battlefield,[A]
stained with blood...[A]
[0AAA]

[0AAB]

[0AAC]

[0AAD]

[0AAE]
Ostia's military primarily consists of
soldiers in heavy defense gear,[A]
such as Armor Knights and Generals.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With them, Castle Ostia's defenses
have always been incredibly strong.[A]
For a long time now, the castle has been
rumored to be "unconquerable."[A]
However, that rumor was about to be
proven wrong.[A]
By [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy, who, ironically, wished
to protect the castle.[A]
[0AAF]

[0AB0]

[0AB1]

[0AB2]

[0AB3]

[0AB4]

[0AB5]

[0AB6]

[0AB7]
Roy vowed to protect Lilina forever.
However, with Bern coming full force at them,[A]
Roy's army wouldn't stand a chance.[A]
Therefore, they decided to try
and take the Divine Weapons before[A]
Bern got their hands on them.[A]
Lilina showed them to a cave

in the outskirts of Ostia,[A]
where the first Divine Weapon was hidden.[A]
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,
was going to be a major ordeal for Roy.[A]
[0AB8]

[0AB9]

[0ABA]
After driving off General Narshen from
Ostia, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company braced themselves[A]
for further attacks from [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern.[A]
However, Bern's belligerent movement
towards Lycia suddenly stopped altogether,[A]
as if to mock Roy and his caution.[A]
Bern was also maintaining a neutral
position regarding the truce offer[A]
from Etruria.[A]
Bern's sudden silence and lack of
activity could only be described as eerie.[A]
[0ABB]
With Hector gone, Eliwood was now the
only lasting power in Lycia.[A]
Eliwood summoned the various marquesses to
Pherae to discuss their future actions.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It was decided that Eliwood was to
become the next leader of the Lycia Alliance[A]
and that a new Lycia Alliance Army would
be established.[A]
This new army's purpose was not to
take the offense against Bern, but[A]
rather take a defensive stance for Lycia.
For his victory against Bern in Ostia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy was chosen to be the leader of
the new Lycia Alliance army.[A]
[0ABC]
Slowly but surely, the people of Lycia
were starting to brighten up.[A]
Business was improving, and people's
attitudes started to get more optimistic.[A]
Around that time, Etruria called for Lycia's
assistance in ridding the [LoadOverworldFaces]Western Isles of
the outlaws and bandits making their base[A]
base there.[A]
[0ABD]
Lycia's citizens expressed their discontent
by saying that they saw no reason in sending[A]
troops all the way to the Western Isles, but
because Lycia needed Etruria's protection[A]
against Bern, they had no choice but to
oblige.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Thus, Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army
passed through Etruria and made their way[A]
towards the Western Isles.[A]
[0ABE]
The Western Isles are the various
islands off the western coast of Elibe.[A]
Currently, they are colonies of Etruria.
The Western Isles are rich in minerals[A]
and natural resources, so mining[A]
is a major industry. However, these
minerals are worth a fortune,[A]
so various [LoadOverworldFaces]rogue groups have traveled
there hoping to loot the mines[A]
and sell the minerals for themselves.[A]
Thus, the people living on the Western Isles
spend their days in constant fear[A]
of bandit attacks.[A]
And Roy had been sent
to defeat these bandits.[A]

[0ABF]
Roy accompanied Cecilia to the
Etrurian capital of Aquleia.[A]
[0AC0]
After debating about Roy and Guinevere's
Position, the Etrurian Court decided[A]
[0AC1]
that they had no reason to attack Bern
when they hadn't suffered a direct[A]
offense.[A]
[0AC2]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at Aquleia, and the Lycia[A]
Alliance Army was to be an independant
[0AC3]
squad under the Etrurian Military.
To test his worth, Etruria sent Roy[A]
[0AC4]
to the Western Isles, where his
mission was to rid the islands[A]
[0AC5]
of bandits there. The Western
Isles is an archipelago under[A]
[0AC6]
Etrurian protection lying to the west
Of the mainland. Many mining[A]
[0AC7]
corporations have sprouted up, trying
to monopolize the rich minerals that[A]
[0AC8]
lie in the islands' soils. However,
the riches attracted many bandits,[A]
[0AC9]
and the people lived in
constant fear of them...[A]
[0ACA]
3 seperate islandsア Fibernia,[LoadOverworldFaces][A]
[0ACB]
Caledonia,[LoadOverworldFaces][A]
[0ACC]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and Dia.[A]
All of these islands are rich
in mineral resources,[A]
and mining has become a large industry.[A]
The largest mine is located in
[LoadOverworldFaces]Mt. Ebrakhm, in the north of Fibernia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy turned his forces towards
Ebrakhm hoping to gather some information
[A]on the bandits.[A]

[0ACD]
To get to Mt. Ebrakhm, one must go
past the castle that is located in [A]
Ebrakhm valley.[A]
Therefore, Roy sent a messenger to [LoadOverworldFaces]Nord,[A]
the castle owner, to be granted permission
to pass through his lands.[A]
Since Roy and company were there because
of an official request from Etruria,[A]
they didn't think that gaining Nord's[A]
support would be as difficult.[A]
[0ACE]
Roy couldn't believe Lalum's story.[A]
He quickly penned off a letter to [LoadOverworldFaces]Cecilia
letting her know of the horrors happening[A]
on the Western Isles.[A]
He also let her know of the actions that he[A]
planned to take from now on.[A]

After sending the letter, Roy and
company moved towards the mine in[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Mt. Ebrakhm to try and rescue the people[A]
[0ACF]
suffering from forced labor.[A]
Etruria had assigned [LoadOverworldFaces]Bishop Oro
of the Elimine Church to supervise[A]
the mine.[A]
Already a large amount of minerals had been
taken, but it seemed they wanted more..[A]
[0AD0]
Ebrakhm... known now as the Mine of Death.[A]
The wails of the people forced into labor
there echo through the mines, like[A]
the howling of ghosts...[A]
[0AD1]

[0AD2]

[0AD3]

[0AD4]
In order to get some information from
the resistance forces about the bandits[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]on the Western Isles, Roy and company
moved west along the coastline.[A]

[0AD5]
Along the way, they came across[A]
a small village caught in constant
conflict between the resistance group[A]
and the landowner trying to get
rid of them.[A]
[0AD6]

[0AD7]

[0AD8]
The Lycia Alliance Army took Elphin as
a tactician.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following his advice, they moved south[A]
toward the isle of Caledonia.
Caledonia is one of the main islands[A]
that make up the Western Isles.
The other two are Fibernia and Dhia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Castle Idina is located on Caledonia. Here,
men from all over the world are rounded up[A]
[0AD9]
and locked in prison cells to be taken
to Mt. Ebrakhm, to the Mines of Death.[A]
[0ADA]
When Roy arrived at Castle Idina,
the situation already looked dire...[A]
[0ADB]

[0ADC]
To rescue the people of the Western Isles,[A]
Roy headed for Djuto, the Isle's largest
city and its capital.[A]

[0ADD]
According to Elphin, Lord Arcard, who was
in charge of supervising the Western Isles,[A]
was an Etrurian of high nobility, but not
of high importance to the Etrurian[A]
government.[A]

[0ADE]
Roy was still worried about Etruria's response
to his attacking the capital,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]but to rescue the people, he had
to get rid of Arcard as soon as possible.[A]
[0ADF]

[0AE0]

[0AE1]

[0AE2]

[0AE3]

[0AE4]
Following Elphin's lead, Roy
headed for the cave near Djuto[A]
to obtaian the Divine Weapon.

[0AE5]
But Roy and company weren't the[A]
only ones who knew of the cave.[A]
Yet another battle was awaiting them...[A]

[0AE6]

[0AE7]

[0AE8]
The coup d'etat at Aquleia quickly
spread out to the rest of Etruria.[A]

[0AE9]
Cecilia escaped with Guinevere from Aquleia.
She also formed an Anti-Coup d'etat[A]
group and traveled around Etruria
fighting the rebel forces.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the rebel forces had Bern on
their side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]King Mordred had been taken hostage,[A]
which led [LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]"Great General" Douglas and[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]"Knight General" Percival to be forced onto
the rebels' side. With these powerful[A]
forces on their side, the rebels
gradually began to push the[A]
Anti-Coup d'etat group of of Etruria.[A] 
[0AEA]
The Anti-Coup d'etat forces had been
driven into an old castle on the island[A]
of [LoadOverworldFaces]Misul to the west of Etruria.[A]
[0AEB]
Roy had learned that Cecilia had been
forced back by the Coup d'etat.[A]
[0AEC]
In response, Roy headed for Misul.[A]
[0AED]
Meanwhile, the Anti-Coup d'etat group
was under attack by a joint force of[A]
Coup d'etat forces and Bern's troops.[A]
It would only be a matter of time before
the Anti-Coup d'etat forces were defeated...[A]
[0AEE]

[0AEF]

[0AF0]

[0AF1]

[0AF2]

[0AF3]
After rescuing Guinevere and Cecilia, Roy
headed towards the Nabata desert, following[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Sophia's lead.[A]

[0AF4]
According to Sophia, there was a
hidden oasis in the desert,[A]
and that's where her village, Arcadia,
was located.[A]
However, at that time, Arcadia was
under attack by Bern's forces.[A]
Their aim may be the Dragons
that are said to inhabit the village.[A]

[0AF5]
Although the Lycia Alliance Army moved
as quickly as they could towards Arcadia,[A]
a vicious sandstorm stood in their way.[A]
[0AF6]
In the hidden village, Arcadia,
stands an ancient temple.[A]
One of the divine weapons
is said to be hidden in it.[A]
Roy and company were quick to
follow Bern's troops,[A]
who had already found their way
into the temple...[A]
[0AF7]

[0AF8]

[0AF9]

[0AFA]
After saving the hidden vilage of Arcadia,
Roy's army found their way out of[A]
the desert, following Igrene's lead.
Now, they turned toward Etruria[LoadOverworldFaces]to confront[A]

[0AFB]
the Coup d'etat forces. At this point, a[A]
a disturbing message came from
the Elder of Arcadia.[A]

[0AFC]
Apparently, Fa, the little Dragon girl, had
left Arcadia, following Roy. If she were to[A]
fall into the hands of the Coup d'etat
forces or of Bern, who stood behind them,[A]
it would be a disaster.[A]

[0AFD]
Bent on finding Fa, Roy moved his[A]
forces toward a small fort
near the Etrurian border.[A]
[0AFE]

[0AFF]

[0B00]
After rescuing Fa,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy headed for Aquleia.[A]

[0B01]
The capital of Etruria,[A]
Aquleia is also the largest,
most prosperous city on the continent.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Preparing for the Lycia Alliance Army's
attack, the Coup d'etat army concentrated[A]
forces in Aquleia. Originally they had
planned on using the garrison of the city[A]
for defense, but since the [LoadOverworldFaces]Elimine Church
had turned to Roy's side, the Coup d'etat[A]
Army had no choice but to retreat to the
castle and take post there instead for fear[A]
that the Church may have encouraged the
city denizens to protest.[A]
[0B02]
The Elimine Church was started by "Saint
Elimine, one of the Eight Heroes. This[A]
religious organization had many followers,
primarily in [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern and Etruria.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy had gained the Church's support
in attacking Aquleia.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Narshen and his elite troops[A]
were waiting for Roy inside the castle.[A]

[0B03]

[0B04]

[0B05]

[0B06]

[0B07]

[0B08]

[0B09]
At the request of King Mordred, Roy
headed for the Tower of the Saint on[A]
the outskirts of Aquleia.
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Tower of the Saint was a place of[A]
worship for Saint Elimine, one of the
Eight Heroes, and in the tower lay[A]
various holy object relating to her.[A]
However, this sacred tower was now
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]under the control of Bishop Windam,[A]
who had rebelled against the Elimine
Church by Roartz's orders.[A]
[0B0A]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
forces flocked to Anti Coup d'etat group,[A]
forcing out the Coup d'etat Militia.
Roartz and Arcard were driven out of[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Etruria and fled [LoadOverworldFaces]north to Ilia, [LoadOverworldFaces]
which was under Bern's control.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ilia, or the Frozen Highlands, is a
land with short summers and long winters.[A]
[0B0B]
With little arable land, the
nation's main source of income[A]
was sending mercenaries out to
fight for pay.[A]
[0B0C]
The now free Kingdom of Etruria
joined its forces with the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Now a joint force under the name of the[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Etrurian Army, their first mission was[A]
to enter Ilia to finish off the Coup d'etat
Forces. After that, they would launch direct[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]attacks on Bern. [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy, nominated as leader of
of the Etrurian Army, had[A]
the powerful support of the
Elimine Church, getting the[A]
people on his side.[A]

[0B0D]
However, Roy had to face the freezing
cold of Ilia, as well as the[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]elite troops under General Murdock,[A]
the leader of the 3 Dragon Lords.
In addition, some of the powerful[A]
Ilian Knights had turned to Bern's side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As a start, Roy headed for Castle
Raemy, located on the Ilian border.[A]
[0B0E]

[0B0F]

[0B10]

[0B11]

[0B12]

[0B13]

[0B14]

[0B15]

[0B16]

[0B17]
After defeating Arcard, Roy moved
east deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Soon, they entered the thick forests
that characterize Ilia's central land.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, a general of Bern,
Bishop Martel, was waiting for them[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]with an ancient spell that was
said to have been lost centuries ago...[A]

[0B18]

[0B19]

[0B1A]

[0B1B]

[0B1C]

[0B1D]
After defeating Martel and making it
through the forest,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company faced the blizzards that
are common of Ilia's winters.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ilia's harsh weather has been a natural
defense in itself against invaders.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Coupled with Ilia's greatest natural weapon,
Sigune, captain of the Pegasus Knight[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Squad that had turned to Bern, was
preparing to attack Roy.[A]
[0B1E]

[0B1F]

[0B20]

[0B21]

[0B22]
After defeating Sigune,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy headed for Edessa,[A]
located in the northeast of Ilia.[A]
[0B23]
Castle Edessa, owned by [LoadOverworldFaces]Zealot, leader of
the Ilian Mercenary knights, once served as[A]
headquarters of the Pegasus Knight teams[A]
as well.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, with Zealot gone, Bern saw its
chance and attacked the castle, forcing[A]
the Mercenary and Pegasus Knights into
submission.[A]
Castle Edessa was [LoadOverworldFaces]Murdock's headquarters,[A]
but since Murdock had returned to Bern,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roartz was put in charge.[A]
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's
speed in advancing to Edessa,[A]
Roartz hurriedly contacted the
various Ilian knight groups asking[A]
them for aid.
However, their replies were not promising.[A]
[0B24]

[0B25]

[0B26]

[0B27]

[0B28]

[0B29]

[0B2A]
After taking back Castle Eldessa,
Roy turned his troops toward the ancient ruins[A]
located on the outskirts of the town.
There is a high chance that a[A]
Divine Weapon is hidden there.[A]

[0B2B]

[0B2C]

[0B2D]

[0B2E]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
powers slowly began to change their[A]
views and express their anti Coup d'etat
opinions. Driven away from their palace,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roartz [LoadOverworldFaces]and Arcard fled to[LoadOverworldFaces]
Sacae, which was still under Bern's control.[A]

[0B2F]
Sacae is the vast plain-covered
land in the center of the continent.[A]
Before Bern invaded, the various tribes
there led nomadic lives.[A]
[0B30]
The Etrurian army joined the Lycia Alliance
Army to form a joint Etruria-Lycia[A]
Union army. The decision was to head
[LoadOverworldFaces]for Sacae to get rid of the remaining[A]
Coup d'etat forces and also attack [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern,
who was behind them.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Thinking that some Etrurian knight
groups would not approve of being seen[A]
under the Lycia Alliance Army, Roy
oficially named the new Union the[A]
"Etrurian Army" and became its commander.[A]
Roy led the division responsible[A]
for entering Sacae.[A]
[0B31]
The Sacae people are wary of outsiders
in the first place, but even worse,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Brenya,[A]
another one of the Three Dragon Lords,
had gotten the largest tribe in Sacae,[A]
the Djute clan, under submission.
[LoadOverworldFaces]The warriors of the Djute tribe[A]
and Brenya's elite Bern troops stood in
front of Roy as he set foot on Sacae's soil.[A]

[0B32]

[0B33]

[0B34]

[0B35]

[0B36]

[0B37]

[0B38]

[0B39]

[0B3A]

[0B3B]
After defeating Arcard, Roy crossed
the border and [LoadOverworldFaces]entered the land of Sacae.[A]
After Bern invaded, the Djute clan,[A]
the most powerful clan in Sacae, became[A]
its servant. Most of those clans
who stood up against the two joint[A]
forces had already been
decimated.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Although the "Silver Wolf" Dayan,
the leader of the Kutolah clan,[A]
had been retaliating with guerilla
tactics, the situation was dire.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Sacae had basically become
a territory of Bern.[A]
Now, as Roy set foot on the plains
of Sacae, the warriors of the [LoadOverworldFaces]Djute[A]
clan stood in his path.[A] 
[0B3C]

[0B3D]

[0B3E]

[0B3F]

[0B40]

[0B41]

[0B42]

[0B43]
After defeating the Djute Tribe, Roy moved
[LoadOverworldFaces]toward Bulgar, the largest city in Sacae.[A]
[0B44]
As a center of commerce between Etruria,
Bern, and Ilia, Bulgar has had a history[A]
of being a free city without a rule.
However, with Bern's invasion,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Advisor Roartz now had control of[A]
Bulgar under Bern's protection.[A]
[0B45]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy approached Bulgar to liberate it and to
gain some useful information on invading Bern.[A]
[0B46]

[0B47]

[0B48]
After meeting Niime, the "Hermit on
the Mountain", the mysteries of Bern's[A]
Dragons were slowly beginning to unfold.[A]
With more unknowns still needing verification,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy directed his troops towards a large[A]
manor on the outskirts of Bulgar.[A]
[0B49]
There, Advisor Roartz of Etruria[A]
was preparing his defenses against Roy...[A]
[0B4A]

[0B4B]
Roy headed towards the ruins in Sacae,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]after the Divine Weapon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the remaining forces of the
Djute clan were waiting for Roy in the ruins...[A] 
[0B4C]

[0B4D]

[0B4E]
After surviving many hardships,
Roy finally set foot on Bern's soil.[A]
[0B4F]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guinevere guided Roy toward the[A]
Temple of Seals, but in their path
stood Bern's elite troops,[A]
the strongest army on the continent,
led by [LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Murdock, the smartest[A]
and strongest general in Bern.[A]
[0B50]
Etruria and Bern, the two leading
forces on the continent, out for[A]
all-out war. The longest and bloodiest day
yet to be seen by Elibe was about to begin...[A]
[0B51]

[0B52]

[0B53]

[0B54]
Roy ventured deep inside the Temple 
of Seals.[A]
Apparently, there was something else
hidden there other than the Sword of[A]
Seals.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, [LoadOverworldFaces]  Pereth, once of Murdock's best
troops leaders, was already inside[A]
the temple and waiting to attack Roy.[A]
[0B55]

[0B56]

[0B57]
After obtaining the Sword of Seals,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy directed his troops towards Bern's[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]capital, where King Zephiel was waiting.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Inside the castle, Zephiel awaited with[A]
his personal guards at hand.[A]

[0B58]
Roy prepared to charge the castle
to end this war, and to bring[A]
peace to Elibe again...[A]
[0B59]

[0B5A]
 
[0B5B]

[0B5C]
Bern surrendered with King Zephiel's death.
The great war that shook the lands of Elibe[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]was over.
However, Roy's battle was not.[A]
[0B5D]
Roy continued to search for the Dark
Priestess, who could be the Dark Dragon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following the light emitted by the Divine
Weapons, Roy headed for the Dragon Temple.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, waiting for Roy in front of the
[LoadOverworldFaces]temple was Brenya, the one remaining[A]
Dragon Lord of Bern. She had rounded up the
remaining troops and was waiting[A]
to attack Roy.[A]
[0B5E]
A battle with the now dead Kingdom of Bern...[A]
Roy already had a heavy heart at[A]
having to battle these "ghosts".[A]
[0B5F]

[0B60]
lcaring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.[A]
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I understand.[A]
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.[A]
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.[A]
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and[A]
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's Yuno.[A]
[0B61]

After defeating Bern's remaining
troops, Roy entered the Dragon Temple.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He searched for the Dark
Priestess to prevent the same[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]tragedy as the Dragon Human[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]wars from happening again.[A]

[0B67]
Here in the temple, Roy was to
learn the truth of the legends he had[A]
always heard. What Roy was about to hear
was completely different from what[A]
he had always believed to be true...[A]

Here in Lycia, Roy, the young heir[A]
[0B6C]
of Pherae, was studying in the great city[A]
[0B6D]
of Ostia to train himself for his
position. Today, his teacher,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Cecilia of Etruria, is
instructing him on battle tactics...[A]

One thousand years after the great
war between Dragons and men known
as the Scouring...
[.....] 
[0BCE]
Mankind was beginning to
prosper once more.[.....] 
[0BCF]
However, a sudden invasion from
the east threw the continent
into war again.[.....] 
[0BD0]
Those who started the war...
Those who suffered...
Those who stood up...[.....] 
[0BD1]
Countless people fought to the
death to protect what they
believed in.[.....] 
[0BD2]
This is a story of a group of
heroes who withstood the test
of time during this age of suffering...[.....] 
[0BD3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CB][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]B-Boss!
An army's invading our cave![A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
How many of them are there?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dunno, Boss.
I hope there aren't too many of them...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's strange...[A]
The Lycia marquesses should be having
bigger problems than dealing with[A]
bandits like us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well?[A]
What do we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]They probably don't know much about
this cave, anyway.[A]
Just lure them into stepping on the
floor tiles where hot lava spurts[A]
up and get rid of 'em.[A]
[0BD4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, over here![A]
The Divine Weapon is located on
the other side of this lava pit.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]Lilina, are you all right?[A]
Have you calmed down?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[ToggleSmile]maybe I'm not fully all right,
but now isn't the time to be sad.[A]
I need to protect Ostia,
like my father before me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right...
[ToggleSmile]Good for you, Lilina.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm okay because you're
with me, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Did you just say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
Anyway, I'll tell you what I know
about this Divine Weapon.[A]
The one here is the sword that was used
by Roland, one of the 'Eight Heroes.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That Roland... is that King Roland,
the first king of Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, he's our ancestor.[A]
This sword is called 'The Blazing Sword,'
or the Durandal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Durandal...the name has a
strange echo to it.[A]
So Roland used the Durandal to fight
the Dragons during the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's how the legend goes.[A]
They also say that after the war ended,
Roland returned to his hometown of Ostia.[A]
He raised the Durandal high above his head,
and the land that had become barren after[A]
the war suddenly became lush with
vegetation and life again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... that must be some sword.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, it's a weapon that can defeat Dragons.
It must have some special powers in it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
...Oh yeah, I heard that a group
of bandits has made its base here.[A]
Is it going to be all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Is what going to be all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I mean, there's always the chance that
they have might have taken the Durandal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, don't worry.[A]
Only those who are Roland's successors know
how to remove the Durandal from its sheath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, okay.
Then everything's fine.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All we have to do is get rid of
the bandits and obtain the Durandal.[A]
[0BD5]
[LoadFace][0x1CB]Sigh.[A]
What are you guys doing in a
place like this?[A]
Oh well, but since you're
already here...[A]
I can't let you guys go,
can I?[A]
[0BD6]
[LoadFace][0x1CB][ToggleSmile]Crap...[A]
I knew this would happen...[A]
[0BD7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][ToggleSmile]Roy!
Here it is![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So this is the Durandal...
It's a very large sword.[A]
I don't think many of us are
going to be able to swing it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But history has it that Roland
was a small man.[A]
I think it's the person skill in the
sword that determines whether or not[A]
he can use.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then if I become better with my
sword, I can use it as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well... maybe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe?[A]
Come on...at least say 'probably.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hee hee![A]
[0BD8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, here it is!
There was a sword under the altar.[A]
It was a task to get it out,
but we have it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]This is the Durandal...[A]
But was it worth losing Lilina...?[A]
[0BD9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D3][ToggleSmile]So this is the end of the caaave?[A]
Treeaasure...
Where are you...[A]
Answer meee...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150]
Boss... you sure about this?[A]
Bern told us to block the entrance
to the cave.[A]
If they catch us now, we'll be
sent back to prison![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Idiooot![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]We're gonna bury this cave
anywaaay...[A]
Sooo they ain't gonna know that we
took the treeaasure...[A]
If we bury the cave without taking the
treasure, no one's ever going to be[A]
able to fiiind it...[A]
Have ya ever thought about how the
treasure would feel theeen![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Well...
'Guess you're right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151]Boss![A]
There's an army stationed outside
the cave![A]
[OpenRight]Whaaat?[A]
So they think they're going to take
our treasure, do they?[A]
Have the boys near the entrance take
take them ooouut...[A]
And grab all the treasure chests...[A]
They're mine nooowww![A]
[0BDA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]A Divine Weapon lies in this cave...[A][Clear]
It's pretty dark in here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]According to a scholar in Djuto,
if there is a Divine Weapon in here,[A]
it would most surely be the Armads,
the 'Axe of Lightning'.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Armads...[A]
An axe, not a sword this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Armads was used by 'Durban the
Berserker', the largest and most[A]
muscular of the Eight Heroes.[A]
A blow from his axe must have
been quite a sight to see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Elphin, you certainly know a lot about
the Eight Heroes and the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a bard.
I know lots of myths and legends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
I want to hear them, when we have
the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
...Master Roy, it seems we have
company in this cave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are also some strange
fumes coming out of the cave walls.[A]
We must proceed with caution.[A]
[0BDB]
[LoadFace][0x1D3]Daaaahhhhhh![A][Clear]
Rah![A]
[0BDC]
[LoadFace][0x1D3]Guh...[A]
[0BDD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Where is the Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[A]
I can hear wind coming from behind
the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
I can't hear it...[A]
[MoveRight]There's a niche... between the
floor and wall.[A][Clear]
Oh!
It opened![A][Clear]
...So this is the Divine Weapon?
That axe is huge.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Armads...[A]
So this is what Durban the Berserker
used.[A]
It certainly seems fit for a
mighty warrior.[A]
[0BDE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, here it is![A]
There's a large axe behind the
throne![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]This is the Armads...[A]
Durban's Axe...[A]
[0BDF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C6][ToggleSmile]Haven't you found the
Divine Weapon yet![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, we think it is lying inside
this altar, but it won't open...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Break it, force it open, or
do whatever![A]
We do not have much time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]But we must also deal with the
enemies that have entered the Temple![A]
We don't have enough manpower to
use force on the altar![A]
[OpenRight]Then we must get rid of
the enemy first.[A]
Then we can examine the altar
with leisure.[A]
[0BE0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the underground of
the desert?[A]
There's so much... water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D]This is close to a large source of
groundwater...[A]
That's why plants and animals can
live here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
So that's why you were able to build a
village here.[A]
Still, how did you find such a convenient
place like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Athos...[A]
The "Archsage" Athos is
the one who led us here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Do you mean the Athos of the
Eight Heroes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
After the Scouring...
Master Athos traveled around Elibe...[A]
At the end of his journey, he arrived at
a village in which people and Dragons[A]
lived together...[A]
But he said that... it would only be
a matter of time before it was found[A]
by other people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So he led you here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... and he hid his
Divine Weapon inside this Temple...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And...
Can we use his Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Master Athos said that we were to
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...[A]
And if you use it...
it would be to protect us...[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Some of the pathways of this temple
will suddenly sink into the water...[A]
Please be careful...[A]
[0BE1]
[LoadFace][0x1C6]I...wasn't expecting you to
fight so well against all of us.[A]
[0BE2]
[LoadFace][0x1C6]Where... did you learn...
to fight... like this...?[A]
[0BE3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is here...
Inside this altar...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]...[A][Clear]
It won't open...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This altar is made... so that
only those of the village may[A]
open it...[A]
So please allow me...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]There...
There is the Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The one that Athos used?
Then...[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes...[A]
The "Infernal Element," Forblaze...[A]
[0BE4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think the book is inside the
altar, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you get it out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I sent some people to ask the
villagers about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
But don't force them.[A]
If they don't want to give it
to us, then we'll leave it here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A][ClearFace]
[0BE5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
The villagers helped us remove the book
from the altar![A]
Here it is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]
...If the Archsage Athos hid it,
it must be the Forblaze, the[A][Clear]
'Infernal Element'[A]
The legends say that no one
could escape its fiery wrath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We must be cautious with it.[A]
[0BE6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D5][ToggleSmile]Lord Roartz fled!?[A]
Then what would happen to me, who turned
against the Church and took over this[A]
tower?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir, Lord Roartz's message is that he
'Doesn't want to waste time dealing[A]
with useless bishops who cannot even
tame the Elimine Church.'[A][OpenMidRight]That is because that damned Yodel
got in my way...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well yes...
But even if you tell me about it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...All right, fine...
Then this is our last mission.[A]
If we are to die, then the Lycia
Alliance Army is going down with us![A]
Prepare the 'Heavenly Arrows'![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please wait![A]
If we use that, it will hit our
allies as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Quiet!
I do the ordering around here![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...I shall show them...
Hehehe...![A]
[0BE7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]This is the Tower of the Saint.[A]
Saint Elimine's Weapon, the Aureola
Spell book, lies here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Lord Douglas.[A]
You are helping us, who were your
enemies just a while earlier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not have to thank me.[A]
The king ordered me to help you.
Do not worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Besides, you are saviors of Etruria.[A]
It is an honor to be able to fight[A]
alongside you.[A]

Haha...Ha...[A]
[0BEB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Master Roy,
I think we found the spell book.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Douglas,
is this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A]Yes, this is it.[A]
This is the 'Pinnacle of Light,' the
Aureola spell book, Saint Elimine's[A]
weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]May we use it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The king said to use anything in
the tower that you found useful.[A]
And the Elimine Church is on our
side as well.[A]
If we still have trouble, then I can
negotiate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Thank you, Lord Douglas.[A]
[0BEC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, I think we
have found the spellbook.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...This must be the Aureola,
the 'Pinnacle of Light.'[A]
Merlinus,[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to give this to
the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
But the king said we could use anything
we found in the tower.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is the spell book their
saint used.[A]
It would be disrespectful to take it
Without their permission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel?
What is wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About the Aureola...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes.[A]
I will return it to the church
immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please don't.
We want you to take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What Saint Elimine truly wished
for was peace.[A]
Please take it and end this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
I will use it with care.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1E0][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Teck!
The enemy is advancing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There is no need to panic.[A]
These ruins are surrounded by plenty
of enforcement.[A]
They won't be able to come in so easily.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But the enemy has defeated the Ilian
troops and our troops one after another![A]
We do not have a high chance of winning...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We do not have to win.[A]
Lord Murdock said that all we must do
is defend this place.[A]
We must hold out until the enemy gives
up and leaves.[A]

He is the finest example of knighthood.[A]

Is there a path leading inside?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably the remaining forces of Bern
buried the pathways to defend themselves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then they must not have had much

[ToggleMouthMove]...This is Barigan's spear Martre...[A]
It's beautiful, as if made of crystal
and ice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Master Roy,
Bern's troops are escaping.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.[A]
All right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right?
We must attack them now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, don't.[A]
They are fleeing.
They don't have anymore will to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]They have families as well.[A]
There's no need to fight more
than necessary.[A]

[0BF6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]The Etruria Army is here![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CE]They want to make here theirs as well...
We will not let that happen.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Tell our brothers that we will defend
this land till the death.[A]
We will avenge our dead comrades![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes![A]
[0BF7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The Divine Weapon lies here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight]Shin, do you know about this
place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All I know is that the Divine Warrior
Hanon's bow, the Miurgre or the 'Bow[A]
of Winds' is kept here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hanon...[A]
She and Saint Elimine were the only
two women among the Eight Heroes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Watch your back.[A]
The Djute will give us everything they've
got to avenge their clansmen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, we have to be careful.
Let's go![A]
[0BF8]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight]Elphin do you know about this
place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All I know is that the Divine Warrior

[0BFB]

[0BFC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CE]They fell into the trap!
Get them now![A]
[0BFD]
[LoadFace][0x1CE]Feel the wrath of the
Djute's bond![A]
[0BFE]
[LoadFace][0x1CE]My brothers will
surely avenge me...[A]
[0BFF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]It's here![A]
The bow is hidden in the altar![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]This is the Miurgre...[A]
It looks like an ordinary bow,
but it must have incredible force.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Master Roy, Bern's troops are
retreating.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.[A]
All right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right?
We must attack them now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, don't.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]They are fleeing.
They have no more will to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]They have families as well.[A]
There's no need to fight
more than necessary.[A]
[0C00]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C7][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]So the battle above ground was
lost...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have liked to be at Lord
Murdock's side when he fell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We share your feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]However, we have an important mission
given from Lord Murdock.[A]
We must defend this Divine Weapon.[A]
The Silencing Darkness, Apocalypse,
must not get into the enemy hands![A]
[0C01]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]There is a Divine Weapon under here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]
I have only heard rumors within the army,
but apparently there is a spell book here[A]
that was placed to protect the Temple of
Seals from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]This place is guarded by Bern's troops
as well.[A]
It is highly probable that the spell book
that she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
We're going up against Zephiel soon.[A]
...I want to have as many weapons as
possible before we enter the castle.[A]
We have to get that book.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E]I have also heard rumors that there are
traps all over the underground level.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Apparently they are so well-crafted
that we could not possibly find a[A]
trap before it is set off.[A]
Perhaps thieves would be better at
finding traps...[A]
Anyway, please be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Let's be wary.[A]
[0C02]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]There is a Divine Weapon under here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]

[0C03]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere,
is this where the Divine Weapon is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably...[A]
I only have heard rumors that a spell
book here was placed to protect the[A]
Temple of Seals from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]This place is guarded by
Bern's troops as well.[A]
It is highly probable that the spell
book she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
We're going up against Zephiel soon..[A]
I want to have as many weapons
as possible before we enter the castle.[A]
We have to get that book.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]I also understand there are numerous
traps placed in the underground level.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
They are so well designed that it would
be impossible for us to find them.[A]
Perhaps thieves would be better at
finding them...[A]
Please be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Princess.
We will be careful.[A]
[0C04]
[LoadFace][0x1C7]
Darkness from an age
long forgotten...[A][Clear]
I will show you its power.[A]
[0C05]
[LoadFace][0x1C7]
[ToggleSmile]Dark...[A]
It is getting so dark...[A]
[0C06]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin, do you know what this
spell book is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is probably the Apocalypse
spell book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apocalypse?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is also known as the
Silencing Darkness.[A]
Bramimond... the most mysterious
of the Eight Heroes, used it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Brammimond...[A]
I only know his name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We don't even know if Bramimond
is male or female, old or young.[A]
None of the old scrolls say
anything specific about Bramimond.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x157][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I was just thinking.[A]
[OpenLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering why there is always some
kind of trap where a Divine Weapon lies.[A][OpenLeft]...Perhaps it is to warn people that their
power is too great to be dealt with lightly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But still...
The traps are so carefully set.[A][Clear]
There must be other reasons.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]
...I wondered about the same thing.[A]
Perhaps I shall look into it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Please.[A]
