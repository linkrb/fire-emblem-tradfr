[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the Sword Saint...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...They gave me that name against
my will.[A]
Just call me Karel.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Karel, I am a Dragon
Knight of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...You're not going to say
anything?[A]
My father said you fought against
Bern in the past.[A]
He saw you in a rain of blood,
slicing all those who crossed[A]
through your path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I am through with this world.[A]
Bern, Etruria...[A]
They are meaningless words to
me now.[A]
I am only here for my family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
If only I could think like that...
But I can't...[A]
Not even after Bern has fallen...[A]

[0A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hey hey![A]
Aren't you knights going to the
castle?[A]
This may not be much...[A]
But this is something we'd
really like to offer you.[A]
Please use it well![A]
[0B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F][CloseSpeechFast]It's awful...[A]
Soldiers from Bern were able
to cross the border...[A]
They laid an awful attack.[A]
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...[A]
He can no longer stand too well...[A]
[0C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x164][CloseSpeechFast]Hey![A]
If you wanna do well in battle
you better use the terrain wisely.[A]
Like if you're in a forest,
the trees will cover you![A]
There's no way enemies will have
an easy time in that situation.[A]

[06]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?[A]
Why are you in such a hurry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy![A]
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118]WHAT!
Is Lord Eliwood safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attacks.[A]
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x109][NormalPrint]Excuse me, Lance, is it?[.....]
Is Lady Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you from Ostia?[A]
Lady Lilina is in the castle.[A]
She should be all right,[A]
as long as Lord Eliwood is with her,
but he can't last forever.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]No...[A]
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][FastPrint]Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must recapture the castle![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x11C]Wolt is right.
We must hurry![A][OpenRight][NormalPrint]Yeah.
You're right.[A][Clear]
[FastPrint][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]All right, let's go![A]
We're going to save those trapped
in the castle![A]
