[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were captain of the Fleet!\n13. There's no way Bern could defeat you.[A]\n14. [OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]\n15. Well, you'll be sorry to hear\n16. that I was captured.[A]\n17. [OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, that's...[A]\n18.

[OpenMidLeft]Does that make you\n29. so excited?[A]\n30. [OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]\n31. I became a Pegasus Knight because\n32. I wanted to be like you.[A]\n33.

I thought you were originally[A]\n51. fighting for the army that was\n52. fighting against this Etrurian Army.[A][Clear]\n53. You didn't...[A]\n54. [OpenMidRight]No![A]\n55. I didn't go against the Ilian\n56. Mercenary Code.[A]\n57. I fulfilled my duties as a\n58. mercenary, and then joined the[A]\n59. Etrurian Army.[A]\n60. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course...[A]\n61.

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere,\n51. we will attack Bern now.[A]\n52. So may I ask...[A]\n53. [OpenMidLeft]... The rest of the story.[A]\n54. [OpenMidRight]King Zephiel was an outstanding pupil in\n55. his studies, he was skilled in war craft...[A]\n56. He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.[A]\n57. [OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]\n58. [OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But still the former king\n59. did not look kindly at him.[A]\n60. [OpenMidLeft]In fact...[A]\n61. Our father began to hate Zephiel\n62. because he grew to become such a[A]\n63. brilliant and worthy youth.[A]\n64. [OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...\n65. is that supposed to mean...?[A]\n66. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father was a man of ordinary\n67. skill and intellect.[A]\n68. Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill\n69. made our father cold towards him.[A]\n70. [OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Jealousy...?[A]\n71. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]And then one day, our father\n72. told Zephiel that 'the next heir to[A]\n73. Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'[A]\n74. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What!\n75. That's awful![A]\n76. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel was very patient.[A]\n77. He said that he did not mind even if\n78. he did not gain the throne.[A]\n79. But the people around us, who were\n80. looking forward to Zephiel's ability[A]\n81. to be a good king, would not allow\n82. anyone else to be the heir.[A]\n83. Pressured by the public, our father\n84. lost his patience at last, and...[A]\n85. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Decided to kill King Zephiel...?[A]\n86. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel\n87. a poisoned drink from his own hands.[A]\n88. And that was the first and last cup\n89. that Zephiel ever took from our father.[A]\n90. After returning to his room, Zephiel\n91. started to get sick.[A]\n92. For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered\n93. between life and death.[A]\n94. But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and\n95. loyal general, saved his life.[A]\n96. [OpenMidRight]... The former king never did\n97. anything after that?[A]\n98. [OpenMidLeft]No...[A]\n99. But I have heard that he had plans\n100. to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's[A]\n101. mother as traitors.[A]\n102. He was scheming to murder them all\n103. along with Zephiel.[A]\n104. After hearing that, Zephiel made\n105. believe he was dead.[A]\n106. Our father then checked the coffin to\n107. confirm Zephiel's death.[A]\n108. [01AF]\n109.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I did some research after\n45. receiving your letter.[A]\n46. And I have come to the conclusion\n47. that Bern has indeed resurrected[A]\n48. [Clear][ToggleSmile]the Dark Dragon![A]\n49. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Is that true!?[A]\n50. ... But Hartmut defeated the\n51. Dark Dragon in the war.[A]\n52. How could Bern have brought\n53. it back to life?[A]\n54. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Apparently Hartmut did defeat the\n55. Dark Dragon, but he did not[A]\n56. finish it off.[A]\n57. [OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What!?[A]\n58. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Instead of killing it, he sealed\n59. it away in the mountains of Bern.[A]\n60. And the sword he used to seal\n61. it was...[A]\n62. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Sword of Seals?[A]\n63. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, did you know?[A]\n64. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.\n65. I studied a little...[A]\n66. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Even if the Dark Dragon has broken out\n67. of its seal, if we can obtain the[A]\n68. Sword of Seals, then we may be able to\n69. seal it again or kill it once and for all.[A]\n70. That is the Church's conclusion, and they[A]\n71. sent me to ask for your assistance.[A]\n72. [OpenMidRight]Do you know where\n73. the Dark Dragon is?[A]\n74. [OpenMidLeft]Yes, my next point.[A]\n75. As the fire-breathing Dragons\n76. can change into human form, it is[A]\n77. highly possible that the Dark Dragon\n78. is as well.[A]\n79. In fact, we currently have a suspect.[A]\n80. The Dark Priestess that is always\n81. at King Zephiel's side.[A]\n82. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Dark Priestess...[A]\n83. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]\n84. We have no solid evidence, but it[A]\n85. is true that she appeared at around the\n86. same time that the other fire-breathing[A]\n87. Dragons started to appear.[A]\n88. [OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]\n89. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their\n90. power in gems called Dragon Stones to[A]\n91. change into human form so that they could\n92. adapt to this environment.[A]\n93. In that case, it would not be surprising\n94. if the Dark Dragon was in the form of[A]\n95. human woman as well.[A]\n96. [OpenMidRight]In any case,\n97. we have to go see her to[A]\n98. confirm the truth.[A]\n99. [OpenMidLeft]Yes.\n100. I shall accompany you as well.[A]\n101. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You would fight alongside us?\n102. That would be most helpful![A]\n103. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Also, take these.[A]\n104.

[OpenMidLeft]All the bad things that happened are\n11. all our fault.[A]\n12. I would have expected you humans to\n13. think like that.[A]\n14. But the truth is what I said.[A]\n15. [OpenMidRight]Then the Divine Weapons were sealed\n16. away so as not to let such a[A]\n17. disaster happen again?[A]\n18. Then all those traps that protected\n19. them were to warn us...[A]\n20. [OpenMidLeft]You sealed them away?\n21. That was a good decision.[A]\n22. But they seem to be in\n23. your hands right now.[A]\n24. [OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]\n25. [OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[A]\n26. The weapons do not seem to have\n27. as much power as they did in the past.[A]\n28. They are unable to bring about\n29. a disaster again.[A]\n30. [OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]\n31. [OpenMidLeft]The great disaster hurt us\n32. Dragons greatly.[A]\n33. [OpenMidRight]How?[A]\n34. [OpenMidLeft]The disaster was originally the reason\n35. why we lost to the humans...[A]\n36. I shall continue when you advance\n37. a bit further...[A]\n38. [01FA]\n39.

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please continue the story.[A]\n43. [OpenMidLeft]When the order of nature collapsed,\n44. we Dragons took a fatal blow.[A]\n45. The forces of nature weakened,\n46. and it became difficult for us[A]\n47. to retain our original Dragon form.[A]\n48. Therefore, we decided to seal our\n49. powers in gemstones and take the[A]\n50. human form instead.[A]\n51. [OpenMidRight]Those must be the\n52. Dragon Stones...[A]\n53. [OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]\n54. Now we were utterly powerless against\n55. the humans.[A]\n56. In human form, we were just as weak,\n57. no, even weaker than the humans.[A]\n58. The humans took advantage of our\n59. handicap and started attacking the[A]\n60. Dragons that had taken human form.[A]\n61. [OpenMidRight]Why did you take human form?[A]\n62. [OpenMidLeft]In the new order of nature, the\n63. human was the form that required the[A]\n64. least energy to transform into.[A]\n65. The Eight Heroes mercilessly crushed\n66. us, helpless in our human form.[A]\n67. I too suffered a deep wound.[A]\n68. [OpenMidRight]Do you have hate for the\n69. humans who wounded you?[A]\n70. [OpenMidLeft]Hate?\n71. Only humans have such ridiculous emotions.[A]\n72. We battled to maintain our species, and\n73. we lost.[A]\n74. That is all.[A]\n75. [OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]\n76. [OpenMidLeft]However, you humans might\n77. lose this time.[A]\n78. [OpenMidLeft]Some human named Zephiel brought\n79. the Dark Dragon back to life again.[A]\n80. [OpenMidRight][MoveRight]!![A]\n81. Then Zephiel did break the\n82. Dark Dragon's seal![A]\n83. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is correct.[A]\n84. [CloseSpeechFast]If you want to hear more, then show\n85. me some more of your worthiness.[A]\n86. [01FB]\n87. [OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yahn!\n88. I know you're there.[A]\n89. [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C]Hm...[A]\n90. It seems that you did indeed\n91. defeat Zephiel...[A]\n92. You might make it far enough\n93. to be able to fight me.[A]\n94. [OpenMidRight]What relation did the\n95. Dark Dragon have to Zephiel?[A]\n96. [OpenMidLeft]You know that the founder of Bern\n97. is the Hartmut, the leader of the[A]\n98. Eight Heroes, do you not?[A]\n99. [OpenMidRight]I know that.[A]\n100. [OpenMidLeft]Then do you know that Hartmut\n101. didn't kill the Dark Dragon[A]\n102. but only sealed it away?[A]\n103. [OpenMidRight]I know.[A]\n104. But I still don't know\n105. why he did that.[A]\n106. [OpenMidLeft]Hm...\n107. I see.[A]\n108. The Eight Heroes eventually defeated our\n109. leader, and they made their way deep into[A]\n110. the temple to find the Dark Dragon.[A]\n111. However, when they arrived at the Dark\n112. Dragon's chamber, all they saw was a[A]\n113. human girl, looking off into space.[A]\n114. It was Idoun.[A]\n115. [OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They didn't fight?[A]\n116. [OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Dark Dragon had its soul destroyed\n117. to follow our leader's commands.[A]\n118.

If you do something you're not used to\n37. during battle, you'll get yourself killed![A]\n38. [OpenMidLeft]No, not in battle.[A]\n39. I was just shooting at some trees\n40. during our break.[A]\n41.

[OpenMidRight]I figured heavy armor wouldn't\n48. suit me very well.[A]\n49. [OpenMidLeft]That is because you are not\n50. training yourself hard enough.[A]\n51. [OpenMidRight]Well, but I wasn't born with...[A]\n52. [OpenMidLeft]This is the perfect opportunity.\n53. I shall train you every day from now on.[A]\n54. Then you may be able to become an\n55.

[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]\n66. [OpenMidRight]No...[A]\n67. [OpenMidLeft]Just keep quiet and\n68. train yourself.[A]\n69. [OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]\n70. [036B]\n71.

That would be the first place they would\n43. look.[A]\n44. So I had to ask you.[A]\n45. But I can't say that I fully trusted you,\n46. a pirate.[A]\n47. However, you kept your word.[A]\n48. [OpenMidLeft]Hey...\n49. No problem.[A]\n50. [OpenMidRight]You could have turned him over to the Coup\n51. d'etat forces and gotten a hefty reward.[A]\n52. Why did you choose to help him?[A]\n53.

[ToggleSmile]...All right, here's what I want.[A]\n110. I want you and your king to\n111. make your country a good one.[A]\n112.

He had no one to joke around with, no\n39. one to talk about his concerns with.[A]\n40. He was always fighting on his own.[A]\n41. [OpenMidRight]Always on his own...[A]\n42. [OpenMidLeft]I don't want Master Roy to suffer\n43. the same fate.[A]\n44. You and Master Roy are the same age,\n45. and what's more, you are milk brothers.[A]\n46. So I want you to stay by Master Roy's\n47. side and give him moral support.[A]\n48. [OpenMidRight]Moral support?[A]\n49. [OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]\n50. Fighting well in battle is important,\n51. but that is not all that is necessary[A]\n52. to show your loyalty.[A]\n53. Think about it.[A]\n54. [039E]\n55. [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wolt.[A]\n56. You don't look so troubled for\n57. a change.[A]\n58. Well, do you still want me to\n59. teach you how to wield a sword?[A]\n60. [OpenMidRight]No, after hearing your words, I cast\n61. away my hesitation.[A]\n62. I will perfect my skills with my bow,\n63. and I will train myself so that Roy[A]\n64. can count on me without doubt![A]\n65. [OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]\n66. With that attitude, it looks like\n67. I can let you take over for me.[A]\n68. [OpenMidRight]What?\n69. B-But if you leave now...[A]\n70. [OpenMidLeft]Calm down, I didn't say right at\n71. this minute.[A]\n72. Still, it won't be that far away.[A]\n73. Once I am gone, you must take care\n74. of Master Roy?[A]\n75. [OpenMidRight]Me...?[A]\n76. [OpenMidLeft]Perhaps taking after an old man\n77. like me would be embarrassing?[A]\n78. [OpenMidRight]No, that's not it...[A]\n79. It's just that...\n80. can I really do it...?[A]\n81. [OpenMidLeft]There now, see?\n82. You have to fix your lack of confidence.[A]\n83. You will worry Master Roy with an\n84. attitude like that.[A]\n85. [OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]\n86. [OpenMidLeft]You can do it.\n87. Have confidence in yourself![A]\n88. [039F]\n89. [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]498...[A]499...[A]\n90. 500...[A]\n91. [OpenMidRight]Sir Alan?[A]\n92. [OpenMidLeft]Phew...\n93. Ah, Wolt.[A]\n94. [OpenMidRight]You're sweating so much...\n95. Are you all right?[A]\n96. [OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, I'm fine.[A]\n97. I was just doing some practice\n98. swings with my sword.[A]\n99. I'm still weak.[A]\n100. I must train myself further.[A]\n101. [OpenMidRight]But...\n102. We're in the middle of a battle.[A]\n103. Shouldn't you be saving your\n104. energy for an emergency, Sir Alan?[A]\n105. [OpenMidLeft]Shh!\n106. ...An enemy![A]\n107. Let's go, Wolt!\n108. Don't lag behind![A][ClearFace]\n109. [OpenMidRight]Wha-?\n110. Y-Yes, Sir Alan![A]\n111. [03A0]\n112.

[OpenMidLeft]Ah...Wolt...[A]\n117. Good to see you...again...[A]\n118. [OpenMidRight]D-Do you really have\n119. to go so far?[A]\n120. You'll be done if you"}], "temperature": 0.2}}
