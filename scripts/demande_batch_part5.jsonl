However, Bern's belligerent movement\n13. towards Lycia suddenly stopped altogether,[A]\n14. as if to mock Roy and his caution.[A]\n15. Bern was also maintaining a neutral\n16. position regarding the truce offer[A]\n17. from Etruria.[A]\n18. Bern's sudden silence and lack of\n19. activity could only be described as eerie.[A]\n20. [0ABB]\n21. With Hector gone, Eliwood was now the\n22. only lasting power in Lycia.[A]\n23. Eliwood summoned the various marquesses to\n24. Pherae to discuss their future actions.[A]\n25. [LoadOverworldFaces]It was decided that Eliwood was to\n26. become the next leader of the Lycia Alliance[A]\n27. and that a new Lycia Alliance Army would\n28. be established.[A]\n29. This new army's purpose was not to\n30. take the offense against Bern, but[A]\n31. rather take a defensive stance for Lycia.\n32. For his victory against Bern in Ostia,[A]\n33. [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy was chosen to be the leader of\n34. the new Lycia Alliance army.[A]\n35. [0ABC]\n36. Slowly but surely, the people of Lycia\n37. were starting to brighten up.[A]\n38. Business was improving, and people's\n39. attitudes started to get more optimistic.[A]\n40. Around that time, Etruria called for Lycia's\n41. assistance in ridding the [LoadOverworldFaces]Western Isles of\n42. the outlaws and bandits making their base[A]\n43. base there.[A]\n44. [0ABD]\n45. Lycia's citizens expressed their discontent\n46. by saying that they saw no reason in sending[A]\n47. troops all the way to the Western Isles, but\n48. because Lycia needed Etruria's protection[A]\n49. against Bern, they had no choice but to\n50. oblige.[A]\n51. [LoadOverworldFaces]Thus, Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army\n52. passed through Etruria and made their way[A]\n53. towards the Western Isles.[A]\n54. [0ABE]\n55. The Western Isles are the various\n56. islands off the western coast of Elibe.[A]\n57. Currently, they are colonies of Etruria.\n58. The Western Isles are rich in minerals[A]\n59. and natural resources, so mining[A]\n60. is a major industry. However, these\n61. minerals are worth a fortune,[A]\n62. so various [LoadOverworldFaces]rogue groups have traveled\n63. there hoping to loot the mines[A]\n64. and sell the minerals for themselves.[A]\n65. Thus, the people living on the Western Isles\n66. spend their days in constant fear[A]\n67. of bandit attacks.[A]\n68. And Roy had been sent\n69. to defeat these bandits.[A]\n70. [0ABF]\n71. Roy accompanied Cecilia to the\n72. Etrurian capital of Aquleia.[A]\n73. [0AC0]\n74. After debating about Roy and Guinevere's\n75. Position, the Etrurian Court decided[A]\n76. [0AC1]\n77. that they had no reason to attack Bern\n78. when they hadn't suffered a direct[A]\n79. offense.[A]\n80. [0AC2]\n81. Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian\n82. Protection at Aquleia, and the Lycia[A]\n83. Alliance Army was to be an independant\n84. [0AC3]\n85. squad under the Etrurian Military.\n86. To test his worth, Etruria sent Roy[A]\n87. [0AC4]\n88. to the Western Isles, where his\n89. mission was to rid the islands[A]\n90. [0AC5]\n91. of bandits there. The Western\n92. Isles is an archipelago under[A]\n93. [0AC6]\n94.

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That Roland... is that King Roland,\n31. the first king of Ostia?[A]\n32. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, he's our ancestor.[A]\n33. This sword is called 'The Blazing Sword,'\n34. or the Durandal.[A]\n35. [OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Durandal...the name has a\n36. strange echo to it.[A]\n37. So Roland used the Durandal to fight\n38. the Dragons during the Scouring.[A]\n39. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's how the legend goes.[A]\n40. They also say that after the war ended,\n41. Roland returned to his hometown of Ostia.[A]\n42. He raised the Durandal high above his head,\n43. and the land that had become barren after[A]\n44. the war suddenly became lush with\n45. vegetation and life again.[A]\n46. [OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... that must be some sword.[A]\n47. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, it's a weapon that can defeat Dragons.\n48. It must have some special powers in it.[A]\n49. [OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]\n50. ...Oh yeah, I heard that a group\n51. of bandits has made its base here.[A]\n52. Is it going to be all right?[A]\n53. [OpenMidLeft]?[A]\n54.

Only those who are Roland's successors know\n59. how to remove the Durandal from its sheath.[A]\n60. [OpenMidRight]Oh, okay.\n61. Then everything's fine.[A]\n62.

Oh well, but since you're\n69. already here...[A]\n70. I can't let you guys go,\n71. can I?[A]\n72. [0BD6]\n73. [LoadFace][0x1CB][ToggleSmile]Crap...[A]\n74. I knew this would happen...[A]\n75. [0BD7]\n76. [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][ToggleSmile]Roy!\n77. Here it is![A]\n78. [OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So this is the Durandal...\n79. It's a very large sword.[A]\n80. I don't think many of us are\n81. going to be able to swing it.[A]\n82. [OpenMidLeft]But history has it that Roland\n83. was a small man.[A]\n84. I think it's the person skill in the\n85. sword that determines whether or not[A]\n86. he can use.[A]\n87. [OpenMidRight]Then if I become better with my\n88. sword, I can use it as well?[A]\n89. [OpenMidLeft]Well... maybe.[A]\n90. [OpenMidRight]Maybe?[A]\n91. Come on...at least say 'probably.'[A]\n92. [OpenMidLeft]Hee hee![A]\n93. [0BD8]\n94.
