[OpenMidLeft]Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Alan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you training as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
After watching, I couldn't just
sit around waiting.[A]
I have to become strong
to protect Master Roy as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
That's the spirit![A]
Become strong,
and surprise Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03A2]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Sir Lance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...I get it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Uh...Sir Lance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
Sorry,
I was thinking some things over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Have I disturbed you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I have reached my conclusion.
It is all right now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you need something,
Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I want to learn by your side.[A]
Teach me to fight like you, so I can
become stronger and protect Master Roy![A]
[03A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Lance?
What are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
I was keeping a record of
this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A record?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
In one of my favorite books, there
is a quote from a famous general.[A]
It saysア[A]
'The most important thing in battle
is information.'[A]
Therefore, I've been keeping track
of who does what in which location,[A]
for both our allies and enemies.
It might be of use someday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In the battles ahead of us, one
mistake could lead us to our deaths.[A]
We must pay careful attention to every
aspect of battle under Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's time.[A]
I must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]He's amazing...
I can't be losing, either![A]
[03A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Sir Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt.
...Are you all right?[A]
Your eyes seem to be
rather red...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes!
I'm fine.[A]
I was just reading the book on
war tactics that you lent me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, good job.
Were you reading it all night?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right,
you might be interested in this next.[A]
It's by the same author, and he describes
his ideas in detail over the course of[A]
24 volumes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you read this, then you should be
able to master the basics fairly easily.[A]
After that, we can go into more advanced
details...Wolt?[A]
Are you listening?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Y...Yes!
Of course![A]
I'll do my best...[A]
[03A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh!
There you are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, hello, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where were you, Father Saul?[A]
You just go wandering off
without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not call it 'wandering off',
Dorothy.[A]
I was diligently doing my missionary
work at the villages on the way here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Were you really doing your job?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
However, while I was doing my job,
a young maiden was being harassed[A]
by a very rude man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You mean yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do I not have any trust at all?[A]
Anyway, I drove off the man and
rescued the maiden.[A]
I must admit, I acted exactly
like a holy man ought to behave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
You're not exactly very strong.[A]
How did you do it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I went to the man and clung to
him, crying,[A]
'I thought we loved each other,
and now you are rejecting me?'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The man fled with haste.[A]
However, the maiden was also
gone when I looked back.[A]
[03A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul!
I've heard the rumors![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Dorothy?[A]
Can I not have at least some
peace and quiet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can't fool me with that calm
attitude.[A]
I've heard what they say about you.[A]
You're trying to ask out every girl
in this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There is a misunderstanding.[A]
I was just trying to
tell them of God's love...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not this time![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've heard that excuse before.
Can't you think of something better?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Then please wait a minute
while I think of one.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the point
if you think of one now!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Dorothy,
why are you so upset?[A]
This happens all the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's the problem![A]
People would misjudge the Elimine
Church if they see you all the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am so insulted!
I am doing my job properly, Dorothy.[A]
Have you not noticed the sharp increase
in our female followers recently?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't you understand?
If you're just asking every girl out...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've had it![A]
You'll have a lot to listen to when
you come back to the church tonight.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
[03A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
I haven't heard a valid excuse
about the other day yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I am sorry...[A]
I am sorry that I...could not
understand your feelings...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see what you were trying
to say the other day.[A]
You wanted to sayア[A]
'If you're asking every girl out...
why don't you do the same to me?'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wha...!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, er, um...
Th-That was just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I am a servant of God...[A]
I must be equally caring to all women.
Please forgive me, Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...Um,
er... I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How did that sound, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I pondered a lot, but that was the
best excuse I could come up with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]V-Violence is not appropriate,
Dorothy.[ToggleMouthMove]
Our loving God surely would not
approve of someone pointing their[A]
bow at an ally...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't care![A]
You better get out of my sight
before I shoot you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...[A]
What are you so upset about?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's your fault![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[03A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][.....][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleSmile]Look out![A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x10C][MoveMidRight]I-I-I'm terribly sorry![A]
I was aiming for an enemy,
but the arrow flew over here...[A]
Oh, what am I going to do?
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm fine.
It didn't even touch me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, I...
I'm so sorry![A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need to apologize.[A]
Things like this often happen
on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even if I did get hit by your arrow,
it would partly my responsibility[A]
for not paying attention to
my surroundings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Never let your mind wander in battle.
That is a rule.[A]
So don't be too upset about it.[A]
All right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, I understand.[A]
I'm probably being more of a
nuisance sitting here mulling over it.[A]
I'll try harder next time![A]
[03A9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That last shot was just luck...[A]
I have to practice more.[A]
Perhaps I should aim[.....]
more like this...[A][Clear]
Oh!
General Percival![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A]
Training?
Very good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes, thank you![A]
I sometimes make mistakes like I did
last time, so I thought I should[A]
train myself more so I wouldn't
be a hindrance to everyone else...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Dorothy, I've been thinking.[A]
You should relax more
when you shoot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...?[A]
You were watching how I fight!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I always try to watch and
understand how my comrades fight.[A]
I was looking for the chance to
tell you this, but I can see that[A]
you tend to panic when you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yes, that's true.[A]
I tend to get scared in an actual
battle, and I get nervous and can't[A]
move like I would like to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Archers don't have to come out
front, they stay back and cover for us.[A]
You must tell yourself that there
is nothing to be afraid of.[A]
We will defend the front lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]! ...Yes! I will![A]
[03AA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]...Yes![A]
Yes, that was great![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Percival![A]
I'm trying to relax when I shoot,
as you said.[A]
I think...
I think I'm getting better at it![.....][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You originally seemed to have talent
with the bow.[A]
It was just a matter of getting your
confidence together, and now that you[A]
have, you'll be improving more and more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can relax if I think that the others
are defending the front lines...[A]
It seems that you can sometimes
feel safe even on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but that is the same for
us up front as well.[A]
We would not be able to charge in like we
do, if we didn't have adequate support[A]
from the back lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Am I being of use to
you too, General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you're helping me out a
great deal.[A]
I shall be looking forward to
your support in future battles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bishop Yodel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Dorothy.[A]
You do not look so well.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know why I can't
use the sacred healing staves?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to help injured people by using
the staves like Father Saul and you.[A]
I've been praying every day, and I don't
think I've done anything bad, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Your faith is an example to us all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I still can't help the injured...
I want to heal them, but I can't.[A]
Will I never have the power?
Am I not worthy to be God's servant?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that is not the case.[A]
Do you know the story of the owl,
and the eagle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I don't.[A]
Please tell it to me,
Bishop Yodel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a story of a time when Saint
Elimine still walked the Earth.[A]
One day during Saint Elimine's
journeys, an owl approached[A]
her from the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The owl asked herア[A]
'I wish to go to the land of God.
Would you show me the way?'[A]
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and repliedア[A]
'God's domain lies high above
the clouds.[A]
Your wings would not be strong
enough to take you there.'[A]
The owl was very disappointed,
and returned to the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Poor thing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A]
We shall continue the
story some other time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Some other time?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not remember the
teachings of Saint Elimine?[A]
You must not try to
understand things in a hurry.[A]
You must think over what you are
told and develop your own opinions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...right.[A]
Then please continue the story
another day, Bishop Yodel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, Dorothy.
I promise you that.[A]
[03AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...After parting with the owl, Saint
Elimine continued on her journey.[A]
The next day, an eagle swooped
down from the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The eagle asked herア[A]
'I wish to go to the land of God.
'Would you show me the way?'[A]
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and repliedア[A]
'God's domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.[A]
Your eyes would not be able
to guide you through the dark.[A]
The eagle was very disappointed,
and returned to the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, the sympathetic and kind
Saint Elimine could not ignore[A]
the two birds.[A]
She backtracked, and brought the
owl and eagle together.[A]
She then told themア
'Journey to the land of God together.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The two birds traveled to God's
land together.[A]
The eagle used his powerful wings to
carry the owl, and the owl used his[A]
great eyes to guide the eagle
through the night.[A]
Together, they were able to reach
God's domain.[A]
That is the end of the story.
Do you understand, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
Sort of.[A]
[03AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About that story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...[A]
[ToggleSmile]So I still don't get its point...[A]
I sort of have an idea of what it
might be about, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then you have an answer, Dorothy.[A]
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.[A]
Each person interprets the story
and comes up with his own answers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, good.[A]
Bishop Yodel,
I think I feel better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, what did Saint Elimine do
after that?[A]
Does the story continue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The journey of Saint Elimine is
a long one.[A]
The next day when Saint Elimine
was continuing on her travels...[A]
[03AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D]General Percival!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.
It is good to see you are well.[A]
It seems that you've gotten
quite used to your position now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Although, I'm still one of the least
experienced and weakest generals...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, from the way I see it, those
working under you are the luckier ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so too,
General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...How have you been doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think
about this army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Frankly, I fee more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.[A]
Perhaps it is because of General Roy..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you feel,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can't say that I feel
completely comfortable here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is probably because what I seek
from an army doesn't exist here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...
You can't get used to this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, it's a little different
from that.[A]
It is just that I am and will
always be an Etrurian knight.[A]
I am unable to bend my
standards so easily.[A]
[03AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...How do you feel about the
coup d'etat in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I still understand that Bern was
doing some things behind the scenes,[A]
but still...[A]
I never would have imagined that the
Etrurian Court would divide into two[A]
hostile sides.[A]
To tell the truth,
I'm still not over it.[A]
I...I never thought that there would
be so many people who give in to[A]
greed so easily...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.[A]
Thus, blinded by peace, we didn't
notice the men scheming.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once this war is over, I will return
and devote my life to rebuild Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, General Percival.[A]
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
I want you to seek a different path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once I return to Etruria, I
plan to dismiss all but those few whom[A]
I can put absolute trust in to
be loyal to the king and country.[A]
I will do anything to maintain
mutual trust among the king's servants.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Percival...
Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidLeft]! Klein...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please, relax a little.[A]
With your ability, you won't have
[ToggleSmile]to go to such extreme measures.[A]
I was holding this in because
we are at war, but...[A]
I'll say it now.[A]
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.[A]
The days when we were more relaxed,[A]
and sometimes even laughed it up
together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once this war ends,
let us return and celebrate the[A]
prosperity of the new Kingdom of
Etruria together...in laughter.[A]
[03B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight]General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.
I just saw you, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You know, I was thinking...[A]
Before the coup d'etat, we never
were working together in the same[A]
mission.[A]
But now, here we are, fighting
alongside each other, after we have[A]
both left the Etrurian military and
are under General Roy's command.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, yes...
Fate can work in strange ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Oh, on a different topic...[A]
Have your favorite foods
changed over the recent years?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
...No.
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's just that the cook was a[A]
little worried.[A]
He says that since you are
expressionless no matter what[A]
you eat, he never knows what
to give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressionless?
...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, very much so,
General Percival.[A]
Even when you have wine, your
expression stays the same no[A]
matter what you drink.[A]
If you stop making expressions,
you'll forget how to make them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressions are not things
that can be forgotten.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't be so sure about
that with you, General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well, well.
Getting fresh, are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Haha...I guess it looks
like I need not worry.[A]
[03B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D]
[OpenMidRight]Excuse me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you need something,
General Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck...
You don't recognize me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well well.[A]
I never would've thought that
you still remember me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
I recognized you at once![A]
You didn't seem to notice me,
so I decided to talk to you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]13 years...[A]
Little Master Klein is all grown
up, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can stop calling me
Little Master.[A]
I'm already 19 now.[A]
I've been working as a general
under the king himself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know.
You've become quite an individual.[A]
How are Lord Pent and his wife?[A]
[OpenMidRight]They're laid-back as usual.[A]
Regardless of the coup d'etat,
they still don't seem to[A]
be that concerned at all.[A]
I really envy them sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
You've become pretty impressive yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well,
we can talk another time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck!
But we just met...[A]
[03B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein!
Don't come out front that much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is still a safe position.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You bowmen should stay
in the back and cover for us.[A]
There's no need for you to come
out and put yourself in danger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck, I told you, I'm not a child
any more.[A]
Until now I've been leading a squad
and fighting in the front all the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry, but you're still
'Little Master Klein' in my eyes.[A]
If I let you get hurt,
I wouldn't know what[A]
to say to Lord Pent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If you're being so considerate, then
you should come back to our mansion.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Dieck, when this war ends, do you
want to return home with me?[A]
Father and Mother would certainly
appreciate it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Klein,
I appreciate your consideration.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you really care about
your household, then you'll stop chatting[A]
with a lowly mercenary like me.
It won't be good for your future.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!? What...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're only talking to me
like this because we're in a war.[A]
Got it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Klein, I told you not to
come talk to me this often.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wanted to tell you a story.[A]
I want you to listen because we're
in such turbulent times.[A]
...It was 15 years ago, at Aquleia's
best arena.[A]
A noble's child was attacked by one
of the lions that were used in the[A]
opening show.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]A young pitfighter was the one who
saved the child.[A]
Ordinarily, he was a skilled swordfighter
who could defeat men twice his size[A]
with ease.[A]
But this time he was up against a
lion, so he didn't come out unscathed.[A]
He was wounded all over his body, and
his face suffered four deep scars.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The noble hired the swordsman who
saved his child into his service.[A]
For several years, the young man
served as the family's pitfighter[A]
and spread his name at the arena.[A]
But one day, he suddenly bought
his freedom and left.
The child, who looked up to the
pitfighter as if he were his[A]
real brother thought that he
 was betrayed, and was saddened.[A]
...But now I understand.[A]
You were thinking the best for
our family..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...You were much too kind to
me, a simple servant.[A]
Lord Pent and his wife raised me
as if I were their real child,[A]
regardless of the complaints and
finger-pointing going on around them.[A]
...That's why I left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand how you feel.
But I don't agree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were always thinking
the best for us...[A]
But did you ever consider the fact
that we were concerned for you also?[A]
I don't want us to be in a relation
in which we ignore each other...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Looks like I was being selfish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
Then you'll be with us like a
family again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you win Little Master Klein.[A]
I'll be sure to show my face to[A]
Lord Pent whenever I get the chance.[A]
[03B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft]That was a rough battle, master.[A]
Would you care to soothe your
tired heart?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you're...[A]
You're the bard that is always
with General Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
My name is Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Elphin, might you be...
No...that's impossible.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Forgive me,
Please forget it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I look very much like[A]
someone you know...
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]! It...can't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here I am standing right in front
of you, telling you myself, yet you[A]
do not believe me.[A]
Did my servants lack trust in me,
Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain![A]
It is you!
Oh...![A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm so glad you're in
one piece, your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have
grown while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Etruria has changed greatly
during the year you were gone,[A]
your Highness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know.
I am sorry to put you through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I was stationed in the Western
Isles, so it didn't affect me too much.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But...you're really alive...[A]
I'm sure all of the Etrurian people
will welcome your return![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[03B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight]Pr-...
I mean, Master Elphin![A]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]...General Klein,
might you spare a moment?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]Yes?
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Master.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Have I...done something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Someone is coming.[A]
We shall continue this some
other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[03B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We can have some
privacy here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pr-...Master Elphin,
you wanted to speak with me?[A]
Is it about Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
It is about the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
Are you talking about the
'Master' thing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not think it is strange
for an Etrurian noble to call a[A]
simple bard a 'Master'?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...!
Yes, you're right![A]
Forgive me.[A]
I shall call you Sir
Elphin instead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
Just 'Elphin' will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That will not do![A]
Even if you are in disguise,
I cannot address my prince[A]
simply by name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]???[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
Do you remember how you used to often
come to the palace with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I've been going to the palace as
long as I remember.[A]
Since I had no siblings, I couldn't
help but think of how cute you were[A]
as a toddler.
And I was still young and foolish,[A]
so I told your fatherア 'Your son
hall now be my younger brother![A]
'He must live in the palace from
now on.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, the prince,
said that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I was a fool.[A]
Of course, your father didn't know
what to say.[A]
And then you spoke up.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And you said the same words.
'That will not do.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]'I'm going to be your knight,
so that will not do.'[A]
Those were your exact words.
You also saidア[A]
'Chose someone else for your
brother!'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I-I was so rude...
I, uh...Forgive me, your Highness..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do not worry about it.
I'm glad you haven't changed.[A]
...When I came back from the[Clear]
[ToggleSmile]brink of death, the world[A]
looked so different.[A]
I'm glad some things are still
the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[03B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Klein!
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to tell you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
When I hired you and your squad...[A]
I was hiring you as an Etrurian
General.[A]
[OpenMidRight]???[A]
Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So if I weren't an
Etrurian General,[A]
you would be free to do
as you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
That's what I told my squad
when we joined this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you don't seem to be taking
advantage of that freedom.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What are you trying to say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tate?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's about what you
said the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said that I wasn't
taking advantage of my freedom...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wasn't quite sure what you
meant, so I wanted to ask you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, since you're free to do what
you want, there's no need for you[A]
to stay here.[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[ToggleSmile]...Does that mean that
you don't need my help?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, that's not what I meant.
Tate, you're a mercenary.[A]
Staying with this army isn't
going to get you much money.[A]
So if you're just fighting
alongside us out of guilt[A]
or a feeling of responsibility,
I just wanted you to know that[A]
you shouldn't feel that way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right.[A]
Perhaps it is inconvenient to
stay with this low paying army.[A]
But I'm staying with you out of
my own will.[A]
Please don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, all right, then.
I'm sorry if I have been a bother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not at all.[A]
[03B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidLeft]Tate, when this war ends, I
could help you find an army[A]
that pays well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, even though you said that
you're fighting with us on your[A]
own will, my being here is still
one of the reasons you stayed.[A]
I just thought that I should
compensate by helping out with[A]
your future plans...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I can do that on my own.[A]
I appreciate your consideration,
but please do not worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Or is my being here a
hindrance to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No!
Not at all![A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why are you telling
me things like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What's the matter, Tate?
How come you're so upset..?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ever since this other day,
all you've been talking about is[A]
getting me out of this army...
Away from you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Well, I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I chose to stay by your side
because I love you![A]
But you...
You're so inconsiderate![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, well...
I'm sorry.[A]
It's just that...I didn't..
know you felt that way about me..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]So...[A]
You know, Tate, you're to
blame as well![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You keep calling me
'General Klein, General Kleinア'[A]
like you want to keep your
distance with me![A]
That's why you make me think
that you're simply tagging[A]
along out of responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]B-But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No 'General' from now on.
Just call me Klein, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.
Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
[ToggleSmile]Oh...Yes...Klein.[A]
[03BA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel...[A]
Do you need something from me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
I thought we might talk a bit.[A]
Are you properly performing your
missionary duties?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, Bishop Yodel.[A]
Due to my hard work, we are getting
more followers every day.[A]
Please, take a look at this list...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hm.[A]
It seems that there are an
overwhelmingly large number of[A]
ladies' names on this list.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, this,
you see...is that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
They must have understood my
pure intentions more than[A]
the gentlemen did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I see.
Very good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Saul, please do not forget
that your main purpose is your[A]
missionary work.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Can't beat him,
can I...[A]
[03BB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul, how is your mission
coming along?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah yes,
as I notified you in my letter,[A]
Master Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Has anything else happened
worth noting?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
I am sorry to put you through
all this, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, please don't be.[A]
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.
That is very noble of you.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
We have been getting complaints
from Master Merlinus that you are[A]
following Princess Guinevere
everywhere she goes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, Bishop Yodel,
that is my mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul, your mission was to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.[A]
And you mentioned it is now in
the hands of Master Roy, not[A]
Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yes,
you are right.[A]
But Bishop Yodel,
please consider this.[A]
I do not think that should be
following Master Roy everywhere just[A]
because he has the Emblem.[A]
That would surely go against
my ethics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Saul?[A]
[03BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean,
Bishop Yodel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I know Master Roy
well enough to trust him.[A]
The Fire Emblem will be safe
in his hands.[A]
What we were fearing surely
not happen now.[A]
Do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps you are right.[A]
..However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I understand what
you are saying, Bishop Yodel.[A]
Master Roy is certainly a
noble person.[A]
Still...[A]
I think this world is a bit too
ugly yet for Master Roy to handle.[A]
I think that I know that more than
the other priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I am still a youngster.
You may forget what I said.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
All right then.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
I recently found this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
This is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]'All wounds treated freely.
Special discounts for new members now.[A]
Sign up today!'[A]
This...treating God like some sort of
vulnerary.[A]
I certainly do not want to think
that someone serving God would[A]
write something like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Saul, would you like to listen
to my lecturing for a little while?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Bishop Yodel, I am certainly
not worthy of having the privilege[A]
of listening to your...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Would you like to listen?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, yes I would,
Bishop Yodel...[A]
[03BD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Oh, dear God...
To have met such a beautiful lady...[A]
Dear God, do you understand my
happiness at this moment?[A]
I am a witness to your work of
beauty standing in front of me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you are Saul,
are you not?[A]
Good day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Oh...Uh, yes, good day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, I was thinking some things
over, and didn't hear what you were[A]
saying.[A]
Would you please repeat what you
said to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Well...[A]
Anyway, General Cecilia, seeing that
we are both servants of God, might[A]
you be interested in having dinner
with me some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
I am not a servant of God.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are, my lady.
Everyone in this world is serving God.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
So can we make arrangements for dinner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I'll think about it.[A]
[03BE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ah,
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have had the privilege
of meeting you again...[A]
It must be your overwhelming
beauty, do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, yes I am.[A]
However, I am only trying to make
you feel comfortable around me...[A][Clear]
Ah, yes![A]
We must decide on a date for our
dinner meeting.[A]
Have you thought about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dinner?[A]
[OpenMidRight]T-This cannot be!
Have you forgotten?[A]
The other day, we met and we agreed
that there is no person in this[A]
world that does not serve God.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes..
I think I can recall vaguely...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Vaguely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then, I suppose it shall
have to be another day.[A]
But please do not forget
next time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I'll try not to.[A]
[03BF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ah!
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Very well, I shall invite you
to my manor when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall be looking forward to that![A]
It is not ever day that one invited
to a high-class Etrurian noble[A]
mansion.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be a[A]
little...difficult.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Difficult?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.[A]
However, once when I was still
a child, I invited a male friend of[A]
mine to our house.[A]
When he saw that, he just drew his
sword on my friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
Is that really a matter of
being difficult?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father lost his temper,
and so we tried to calm him down.[A]
However, it was not easy.[A]
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,[A]
and what was supposed to be a
dinner party became more like[A]
an arena.[A]
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.[A]
That will always be a day to
remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
But my father is still on the
good end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You see, my grandfather can be even
more difficult than my father...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, I just remembered![A]
I had some work left at the church
that I must attend to.[A]
I'm terribly sorry, but since it seems
that arranging a dinner meeting would[A]
be difficult, I shall be off now...[A]
Good day, General Cecilia![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?
Well I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[03C0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Oh, dear God...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That I am able to meet such a
beautiful woman...[A]
This day must surely be blessed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed!
..Ah, before that...[A]
I am Saul.
It would be an honor to know your name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Igrene.
So...what do you need?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, such a beautiful name,
as I imagined.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene...[A]
If I were to describe the pleasure
of hearing such an elegant name...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, there is no need
to describe it.[A]
Do you need something?[A]
Do you know of the Elimine Church,
Igrene?[A]
It is very popular among the nobility,
because when you pray deeply all of[A]
your dreams will come true immediately![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...is that what
you want..[A]
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in God...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, but you must.[A]
If you don't follow the Elimine
Church, you will be cursed![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Is that the kind of God
that you follow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no, I was just kidding around.[A]
How about if have dinner together
some evening, and I can teach you[A]
about God's love...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is truly a miracle that we
can meet again like this.[A]
God must have guided you
towards me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's nice.
Well then, I must be going...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, please wait![A]
It is a wonderful thing to believe,
Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
I used to believe in God as well.[A]
Although it is a different God
than yours.[A]
I think I was fairly serious about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
Why did you stop believing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Several years ago...
I stopped praying.[A]
It was after I lost a loved one
in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those who pray to God expect something
in return.[A]
But they will never receive anything,
and that causes people to hate God.[A]
I think that it would be a lot less
trouble to think that no being exists[A]
in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yes...
You are right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is it all right for a priest
like you to be saying that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is all right,
I am an open-minded person.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However,
Saint Elimine did say this:[A]
'God does not help us
because He believes in us.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Believes...in us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[03C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?[A]
Ah, so you finally decided give
in to the urge, and see me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is about what you said the
other day...[A]
You said that God does not help
us because He believes in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]This is what Saint Elimine said.[A]
God who created this world is all-
powerful.[A]
He can change people and the world.[A]
He can alter us humans so that we
so that we would not be fighting[A]
like this.[A]
However, is that really the right
way?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Humans that act according to God's
[Clear]will alone would be mindless puppets.[A]
God believes that we humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.[A]
God knows that we can overcome our
hardships to achieve harmony.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
I don't believe in God, but I respect
people who think as you do, Father Saul.[A]
I must be off now...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, it is my pleasure to be
able to help you.[A]
Now, we can go on to discuss our
dinner meeting.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Are you Father Saul?[A]
I am Ellen, a sister of the
Elimine Church in Bern.[A]
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dear God...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...Father Saul?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must be blessed to be able to
meet such a beautiful lady.[A]
And you are a follower of the
Elimine Church![A]
This must surely be fate.[A]
Please, let us meet this evening
and we shall discuss the love of[A]
God in great depth.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to.
Shall we set up a time now?[A]
Any time would work for me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are going to talk about
God's love, right?[A]
Why would I even think of
refusing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Satisfaction?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please, never mind.
But Ellen, are you sure?[A]
I am actually rather loose around
women and I may do something[A]
undesirable to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, that will not happen.
You are a priest.[A]
You will surely not do
something like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Er...[ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sorry.[A]
Perhaps some other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
I was looking forward to it..[A]
[03C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Why, hello, Ellen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good day, Father Saul.
It is good to see you safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You are so tense,
so uptight![A]
No, that will not do.
You must relax your muscles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]NL
[03C5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul...
Why did you not come that night?[A]
Everyone was looking forward very
much to your preaching..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, um...
My throat wasn't doing well that day.[A]
We can do that some other time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Father Saul, you really are a
noble person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Excuse me?
Noble?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Usually you appear to be a impious,
improper womanizer.[A]
Hardly someone I would call a priest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there
was a complicated reason to that.[A]
You were putting on a show to show
how free the Elimine Church is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[A]
I, uh...see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting like that would naturally
cause misunderstandings..[A]
Everyone thinks you're just a lazy
man chasing after women...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you purposely walk that path for
the benefit of the Church.[A]
I surely could not do the same.
I sincerely respect you, Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
Well anyways, remember to relax
once in awhile, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father Saul.[A]
[03C6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Lady Miledy,
are you not hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Ellen, I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, if you're going up front, then
please take these vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You seem to be more...
helpful than usual.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
By no means![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you have something to say,
then I'm willing to listen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess I can't force you...[A]
But since we are both serving
Princess Guinevere, I would[A]
appreciate it if you told me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah well, I suppose I'll
wait until you're ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
Lady Miledy...[A]
[03C7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Miledy!
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
You said that I was being more
helpful than usual...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A]
Are you ready to tell me
[ToggleSmile]what's on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Uh...[A]
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Apologize?
For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]When Princess Guinevere and I
decided to go meet the Lycian[A]
Alliance army, I didn't consult
you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I just wanted to apologize
about that...[A]
I knew you had the deepest
loyalty for Princess Guinevere,[A]
and still...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You just followed Princess Guinevere's
orders, like we are supposed to.[A]
You have nothing to feel bad about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ellen, you mustn't always mull over
the past like that if you want to[A]
move forward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[03C8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Ellen, you look a lot
better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I feel like I relieved myself
of a huge load after you were kind[A]
enough to listen to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I'm no good, am I...[A]
I am the cleric, I'm the one who
is supposed to listen to you and[A]
relieve your stress..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen, didn't I tell you before
that you mustn't mull over[A]
things like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm actually grateful that you
didn't tell me when you went[A]
off with the Princess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thankful...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
You protected Princess Guinevere
while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Miledy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's continue to work together to
help Princess Guinevere in the future.[A]
So no more feeling down over trivial
matters, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[03C9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ellen![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Zeiss!?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I knew I saw you in
this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will always be at
Princess Guinevere's side...[A]
Sir Zeiss, did you join to
help Lady Miledy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course that's part of it, but
the main reason I joined is to[A]
see the heart that Princess
Guinevere has for Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
So you will be helping us
as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, not entirely, but...
[ToggleSmile]Yeah, I guess you're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you!
You will be of great assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, well,
I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry,
I must be off...[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, see you.[A]
[03CA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ellen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There was a man over there with
an extremely menacing face...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
Where!?
Oh, him?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Ellen, that person is in
our army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh... I...
I was so rude![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you scream or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You're still scared of men?
Well, I guess I can't blame you.[A]
It was years before you would
speak to me normally like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
It's more like you.[A]
But could you stop
calling me sir?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Okay, okay,
don't stress over it...Well then, see you.[A]
Just tell me if
something happens.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03CB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Ellen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir...Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]These flowers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're the same as the ones you
were growing back in Bern, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ellen?
What's wrong?[A]
Wait, are these the wrong flowers?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you always...
so good to me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?
Ah, er, well...[A]
Well, we come from the same town,
and uh...I don't know, it's just[A]
that I can't...leave you alone,[A]
[ToggleSmile]you know?[A]
I want to stay by your side and[.....]
protect you...[A]
Is that not good?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm very glad...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I must stay at
Princess Guinevere's side...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
I'm also a knight of Bern, so
I'll protect the princess with[A]
[ToggleSmile]with all my strength.[A]
So let's defend the Princess,
and someday we can return to[A]
Bern together![OpenMidLeft]Yes[A]
Thank you Zeiss...
Thank you...[A]
[03CC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Sister![A]
I got the medicine and sheets
that you asked for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, could you leave
them there please?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Well then, I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you an assistant to the
transporter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm fighting as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
A child like you...
in battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I may be still a kid, but
I'm pretty handy with my magic,[A]
you know![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I wasn't doubting your ability...[A]
It's just that... children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm only two years younger than
Master Roy, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy... well, he has no choice.[A]
But that's not the case for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm no different.
I have a reason to fight, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks for being concerned about me.
But I'll be fine.[A]
Oh, I have to go!
I'm in the middle of an errand.[A]
See you later, sister![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[03CD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have a moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, the sister from the other
day![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Ellen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Lou.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're really fighting in the
battlefield...[A]
Are you all right?
Are you injured?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
I'm small, but I'm pretty fast.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lou...[A]
I'm still worried about sending such
a small child into battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I look so small?[A]
Well, if I look at it, it's just
as dangerous to send a lady like[A]
you into the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That... may be true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right![A]
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll protect you.[A]
You can count on me![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, Lou.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please don't do anything rash.[A]
[03CE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x121][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Miss Ellen![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lou?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I thought I saw an enemy near
you, so...[A]
Phew...[A][......]
[ToggleSmile]But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were looking out for me?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
I said I would protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have such a kind heart...[A]
I am sure God would look favorably
on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... When you smile like that,
you look like a saint![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A saint?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I was always worried because you
always seem to look a little sad.[A]
Well, I suppose it can't be helped
in a time like this...[A]
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lou, I feel better when I see you
smile as well.[A]
[03CF]
emlpb[LoadFace][0xE482]srWhat?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of[A]
mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
Thank you![A]
[03D0]
y it?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.[A]
Hmm... this is tough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, I know![A]
I can bring him some food that he
likes...[A]
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I like fruit, but what about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...[A]
[03D1]

 tlr me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03D2]

lbertrouble
when you're surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll be going now.[A]
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't make that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did the other day![A]
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally[A]
make a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.[A]
...There's no way I would shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[03D3]
you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[03D4]
pe.[A]
But that was a decoy...[A]
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
You did your best.[A]
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...I'll try.[A]
[03D5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Hm...
So this is a wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...[A]
Bishop Yodel of the
Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, pleased to meet you,
Miss Miledy.[A]
She is so passive...[A]
I would have imagined wyverns
to be more ferocious creatures.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Trifinne will spread her wings and
bare her fangs at my commands.[A]
However, that is due to the
training by the Bern Army.[A]
...Perhaps she wishes not to
be fighting at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Trifinne and I trained together ever
since we were still little.[A]
We trained hard to become a proud
Dragon knight in the service of[A]
our country.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I...[A]
I don't regret leaving Bern
with Princess Guinevere.[A]
of Bern...[A]
It is painful to fight against
my former allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I'm trying hard to
get used to it.[A]
For Princess Guinevere...
and for my country.[A]
[03D6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong,
Miss Miledy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
It's just that my house is
in this area.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah...[A]
So you have family there?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, my grandfather and my parents.[A]
Both my father and his father would
tell us stories of how they defeated[A]
legions of enemies in their time.[A]
They were so elated when my brother
and I were knighted as Dragon[A]
Knights as well...[A]
I wonder what they're doing now...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Miss Miledy...[A]
Your path has been a difficult
one indeed.[A]
Forgive me, I can't do anything
for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I appreciate you listening to
me like this.[A]
Perhaps...[A]
I was looking for someone
to talk to.[A]
If I will suffice, I shall be more
than happy to hear your concerns.[A]
Don't forget, Miss Miledy...
You are not alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,
Bishop Yodel...[A]
[03D7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel, I must thank you
For helping me so I wouldn't[A]
feel so alienated in the army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
It is my pleasure.[A]
Trifinne...your master is a very
kind-hearted person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a lot of
stress, too.[A]
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...[A]
I've dragged her along with my
selfish motives...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that Bern's training
implements absolute loyalty in its[A]
troops.[A]
Both in their knights, and their
mounts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is the case, then why is
Trifinne following your orders[A]
and fighting against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am sure that there were other
Dragon Knights and even Bern's[A]
in the enemy ranks.[A]
If this wyvern is simply a
creature that would follow the[A]
army's commands, she would not
be here with you now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand?[A]
This wyvern thought on her own
and made up her own mind.[A]
She chose to be with you.[A]
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...She made up her own mind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are a blessed person,
Miss Miledy.[A]
You always have close friends
at your side.[A]
You don't need me to do
anything special.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
Thank you...[A]
[03D8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Chad!
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?
Something smells good...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Here you go.
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey,
baked tarts![A]
Where'd you get these?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The meal delivery man
gave me some extra ones.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Man, they look good...
I can really have them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes!
...Man, these are good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Haha![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, sorry.[A]
It's just that you always look
really happy when you're eating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
I think that's one of the
best things about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What the...[A]
I'm not gonna give you anything
even if you praise me.[A]
I-I'll be going now.
Thanks for the food![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about.[A]
[03D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh!
Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh, a new pair of shoes?
Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't steal it, all right?[A]
The other day I came across an
old lady who lost her key, so[A]
I helped her out.[A]
She gave me the shoes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then why don't you wear them?
She gave them to you, not me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
My shoes aren't as beat up as
yours, and besides, they're a[A]
little small for me, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But we're about the same height.[A]
If they're small for you, they
would be small on me, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]J-Just take them![A]
I'm older, so my feet are a
little bigger than yours![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
That's not right![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course it is!
End of story, okay?[A]
[ToggleSmile]You better wear those shoes,
got it?[A]
See you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Chad!
...Thanks.[A]
[03DA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chad![A]
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A]
No, I was just thinking that it's
been a long time since we joined[A]
this army.[A]
I wonder how the little ones are
doing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I wonder.
[ToggleSmile]I hope they're being good
listening to the Elimine[A]
priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder if they're waiting for
us to return...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sure they are.
We're family, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know...
I'm glad that you came with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Then does that mean you think
I'm strong enough?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I already knew that you were
strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How can I say this...[A]
You have a twin brother,
Ray, right?[A]
So I kinda felt that even
if we three were together,[A]
I would be sort of left out.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean![A]
I always thought of you as
family, just as much as Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know!
Now I know better.[A]
I was just creating a wall around
myself and was trapped inside.[A]
But now I think of you as my
real family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Okay, I'll forgive you.[A]
You're my older brother,
even if you're a...[A]
little...childish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!
Lugh, you![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha...[A]
[03DB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Chad.[A]
Who said you could come talk
to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dammit, I wouldn't if
I didn't need to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy...[A]
I mean Master Roy wants to
see us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like I care.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You idiot![A]
Don't say such things in a
loud voice![A]
That Merlinus guy'll be
after us again![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, are you afraid
of that old geezer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sure am.[A]
He and Master Roy are both
nobles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, so little Chad'll
go bowing down to power?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Laugh while you can.
But let me say this.[A]
If we go against nobility,
we can't complain no matter[A]
what happens to us.[A]
Master Roy doesn't seem like
that kind of person, but I[A]
don't know about the others.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I don't want to watch someone I know
get beat up right in front of me.[A]
You've got quite a mouth, but
if you don't want to get killed,[A]
use it somewhere else.[A]
...I'm going.
You better come, too.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03DC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're still stealing
and stuff, huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
I've got no choice, all right?
I can't use magic like you.[A]
All I can do for this army is pick
locks and go gather information...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, it's pretty good
if you can do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know the other day when we
had to go see that Roy person...[A]
He said that he appreciated the
work of us, who are close to his age.[A]
But you were constantly bowing down
and saying that you never did[A]
anything important.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're doing something only you
can do.[A]
Then why don't you be proud of
it?[A]
You look like an idiot, always
putting yourself down like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Uh, are you trying
to cheer me up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Don't be ridiculous![A]
There would be no reason in hell that
I would be trying to cheer you up![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I thought so.[A]
Good, you had me scared for
a sec there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Dammit!
I'm going![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey!
What's your problem?[A]
[03DD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't ignore me.
I have to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When this war is over,
what are you going to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll go pick up the little
ones first.[A]
Then I'll try and get some money
to rebuild the orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'll go with you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can help out until the
little kids settle down.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I thought so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're actually a good guy
deep down inside.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh always used to say that you
were kind.[A]
I used to think that he was trying
to defend you as his brother, but[A]
I guess not.[A]
He's your brother all right, and he
knows how you really are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're just as naive
as Lugh![A]
Say what you want!
I'm going![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha, there's no need to
get embarrassed...[A]
Hey! Wait!
Don't walk off for real![A]
[03DE]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got talent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, so who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't know me?
I'm Cath, a master thief![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Who?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Ignorant...
I'm your elder.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You should respect me,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
I brushed my stealing skills on my
own, and I will continue to do so[A]
from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no, you're not going to
get any further on your own.[A]
Oh well, I guess you can learn
under my training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait,
why would I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So, you're now my Servant You'll work for me from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why would I!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'd better watch
your mouth.[A]
Isn't this your bag?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey![A]
When did you...[A]
Give it back![A]
[03DF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Give me back my bag!
Now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
Calm down.
Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What are those scribbles?
Who is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Father...?[A]
...You're an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I wasn't good in my studies,
but when I drew pictures, Father[A]
praised me.[A]
He said I had clever fingers, and
that I could be an artist someday...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
I see...[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]......
......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Ah![A]
I don't like situations like this.
I want to live more optimistically.[A]
You should do the same, [OpenMidRight]What do you mean, 
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You.
You're my Servant [OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I never agreed to that![A]

[03E0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Servant How have you been doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been watching you.
You seem to have been improving.[A]
Well of course, you're not as
good as I am, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, whatever.[A]
I never became your servant,
all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
If not my servant, how about
[ToggleSmile]my partner?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Partner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.
We can be partners.[A]
The famous pair of thieves,
out to save the poor![A][Clear]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pair...[A]
...That in itself doesn't sound
too appealing.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Wait a minute![A]
It's the master thief giving you
this offer![A]
I said wait![A]
[03E1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you!
Are you Hugh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
What do you want, kid?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is it true that you're
a moneylender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And if it were?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to borrow 3000G
right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm sorry, kid.[A]
I only lend money to grown-ups
or the hottest chicks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh.[A]
All right then, I'll ask
someone else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey, hey,
wait just a minute.[A]
You're an impatient kid,
aren't you?[A]
You can't just give up so
easily like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you only lend money to
adults or cute girls, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you really insist,
I can make an exception.[A]
But the interest will be
twice the normal rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought it would be something
like that.[A]
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.
I'll give it back to you on the[A]
next payday.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three.
Here you go, 3000G.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.
See you later.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Remember, it's 4000 including the
interest![A]
[ToggleSmile]...How could I turn him down
after he looks at me like that?[A]
This is why I don't like kids...[A]
[03E2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yo!
Here's the money I owe you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4000.[A]
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I keep my promises.
That's natural as a human being.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well you know, it's not so natural
for some people.[A]
Kids sure are honest.
You sure you chose the right job?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop calling me kid.
My name is Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.[A]
Well then, Chad, why'd you
become a thief?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I have to steal to live.
I'm an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You always lived your life alone?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I lived in a small orphanage near
the border between Lycia and Bern.[A]
I grew up with other orphans.[A]
We were doing pretty well, Father
and the other kids and me...[A]
...If this war didn't break out,
I'd still be there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Father was a nice person, but he was
only able to maintain the orphanage[A]
through the help of the villagers.[A]
And then the war broke out, we
started running out of food and[A]
clothing.[A]
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.[A]
So the only way to get food was to
steal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you sent the 3000G to the
orphanage...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
...The orphanage isn't there anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]W-What about the children?
Were they killed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks to Father, we all survived.[A]
The little kids are waiting for me
under the protection of the Elimine[A]
Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I used the 3000G to buy a strong
sword.[A]
I'm going to use it to help end
this war quickly and go pick up[A]
the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So the kids are the family that
you want to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.
I have nothing else.[A]
You got a problem with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
Sorry I made fun of you.[A]
You're already grown up, Chad.[A]
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.[A]
[03E3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey!
Chad![A]
Have you been doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I suppose.
But not as well as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Man, are you always like that?[A]
Can't you say something like,[A]
[ToggleSmile]'Hey, Hugh!
What's up?'[A]
or something with a bright
smile on your face?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sick?
Aw, come on![A]
You know, you got me all worked
up after you told me that story.[A]
I really want to help out![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Mister, are you really a mage?[A]
You sure you're not some kind of
jester or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]M-Mister!?[A]
Wait a minute, you're calling this
superbly handsome young man, a mister!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're a mister from my view.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh![A]
You stabbed me in my sensitive
spot just now![A]
...Not Mister, Mister won't do![A]
You can call me anything, but
not Mister![A]
I have a really sensitive soul,
soul, you know![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... Hahahahahahahahaha![A]
Haha...hee...my...my stomach...!
Hahaha...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh man, that was funny.
You're pretty weird, aren't you?[A]
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
That's okay, right?[A]
Since you say you're not a Mister.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you can laugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, you've always got that
glare in your eye.[A]
Your eyebrows are always bunched
up like this, you know?[A]
And you've got a foul mouth,
you've got an attitude, and you[A]
don't even smile.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying all of
a sudden?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen so many kids who've lost
the ability to smile in this war.[A]
Grown-ups have a lot of issues, but
come on, kids have to be laughing.[A]
Although it seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose[A]
there's still hope for this world.[A]
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a[A]
while, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.[A]
Don't mess up, you got that?[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...[A]
[03E4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir.[A]
Please let me stay with you and
learn from the mastery of your[A]
sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Suit yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you!
...But...[A]
[ToggleSmile]It doesn't feel right that you
are staying here partnering[A]
with me.[A]
I'm still a novice, and you're
the strongest member of our army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]They don't know how
powerful you are![A]
Once they see the true strength
of the Sword Saint, then they'll...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your heart is wandering.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I respect you so much, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is pointless to marvel
over one's power.[A]
That is not the kind of
strength I seek.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, Uncle.[A]
[03E5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uncle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Fir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please, teach me
the way of the sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to know how
you gained your power.[A]
I want to master the sword
like you did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The way of the sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is not something that can
be taught, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A sword is simply a sword.
It is a weapon used to kill people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That...[A]
That's not true![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There's no strength in this
piece of metal.[A]
I have lived by the sword ever
since I was born, but my blade[A]
never gained any power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]True strength is not the
power of a weapon.[A]
It is something that cannot
cannot be seen.[A]
We all have it within us.
Even you, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-Me...?[A]
[03E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please tell me,
Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What is true strength...?
What is the way...?[A]
What...[A]
What must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fir.[A]
You were always looking at your
Mother's back and following after her.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]And you've come to me for advice
because you lost sight of your mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But, Fir.[A]
You are not your mother,
nor are you me.[A]
The path which you seek
does not lie behind us.[A]
It lies in front of you.[A]
It is you who must cut open
that path for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In front...of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That isn't something that can
be taught.
It is something which you must
discover on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
Thank you, Uncle![A]
[03E7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...
I'm terribly sorry about my wife.[A]
If I could take her place, I
would do so in an instant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I can't exactly say that
my sister's health was in good[A]
condition.[A]
I'm glad she lived as long as
she did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One thing I am worried about
is Fir.[A]
She lost her mother at such
a young age...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Maybe...[A]
Maybe the reason she left home
to train herself was that she[A]
wanted to get her mind off of
her mother's death.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Training?[A]
So Fir was traveling around
the continent?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
She said she wanted to become
a great swordmaster like her[A]
mother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[03E8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bartre...
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Karel.[A]
...I was just thinking about
my wife.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About my sister?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I first met her when I was
traveling around the world,[A]
training myself.[A]
And then...
I met her at the arena.[A]
Her sword...it was almost
invisible.[A]
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand.[A]
In our family, the sword is everything.[A]
We are brought up by the sword, and it
is all we know.[A]
The sword was so central to our lives...
even to the point that it blinded us[A]
from our own human nature.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Each time I lost, I would challenge
her to a rematch.[A]
And then, the third time we fought,
I was able to evade her first strike.[A]
I was immediately knocked out by her
second strike, though...[A]
When I woke up...there she was.[A]
It was the first time I saw her
smile.[A]
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves alongside[A][Clear]
each other.[A]
Although...
I was never able to defeat her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You wouldn't see my sister
smile very often...[A]
She must have been that
fond of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?[A]
[03E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...After she fell sick, my wife
started telling me about her family[A]
for the first time.[A]
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you when she left this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Around that time was when we
first met each other as well...[A]
You resembled my wife when we
first met.[A]
You were inhumanly strong...
yet dangerous, and forbidding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
That time, I left you two without
saying a word.[A]
You must have thought what a
[ToggleSmile]terrible brother I was.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.NL
[03EA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You noticed me at this distance?
Impressive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Karel, the Sword Saint.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, what an honor.
You know me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Everyone who uses the sword
knows your name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I traveled all around
when I was young.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why are you in this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My family is here, so I joined
as well.[A]I'm hoping that even my rusty
skills can be of use.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rusty?
Even you joke around sometimes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am serious.[A]
I would probably lose out to
you young ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft]...Interesting.[A]
[03EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]You, please wait a moment.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am looking for someone to
spar with.[A]
Would you care to?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
Am I not a worthy opponent
for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your sword isn't used to kill...[A]
It doesn't agree with the path
I pursue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perhaps you think so now, but we
follow the way of the sword...[A]
All paths of the sword lead to
the same place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]...Do you need something,
Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sense no hate in your sword...[A]
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.[A]
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't cut through air...[A]
Your sword would beat them all.
I want to become stronger.[A]
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place, then would I be[A]
able to blend with the air
as you do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was born in Sacae as well.[A]
I grew up under the protection of
of our Father the Sky, and our[A]
Mother the Earth.[A]
They are all that are in my
sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not a pure Sacaean...[A]
I wouldn't be able to sense
them like you can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Was that true when you
were young?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were able to hear the sky
and earth once.[A]
Although it seems that your
hate is covering your ears.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course you will.[A]
The breeze that runs through
the plains...[A]
It never forgets those that
it loves.[A]
[03ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the Sword Saint...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...They gave me that name against
my will.[A]
Just call me Karel.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Karel, I am a Dragon
Knight of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...You're not going to say
anything?[A]
My father said you fought against
Bern in the past.[A]
He saw you in a rain of blood,
slicing all those who crossed[A]
through your path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I am through with this world.[A]
Bern, Etruria...[A]
They are meaningless words to
me now.[A]
I am only here for my family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
If only I could think like that...
But I can't...[A]
Not even after Bern has fallen...[A]
[03EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Before coming here...
I fought against my older brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]He's not my real brother...
His name was Gale.[A]
He was a Dragon Knight with equal
power to the Three Dragon Lords.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I always looked up to him.
My sister was also very fond of him...[A]
...I never would have thought the
three of us would end up as enemies.[A]
I never thought that we would have
to fight Gale...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]
Have I bored you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
A life story can never
be boring.[A]
[03EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why...[A]
Why did you tell me that
story?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...I thought that you would[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]be able to guide me...
Perhaps you would be able to help[A]
me get rid of my hesitation...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Unfortunately, I don't have any
words of guidance for you.[A]
But...
I can say this.[A]
It is you who must carve[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]your own path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Zeiss...[A]
I think you already
have an answer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.
Perhaps...[A]
I just wanted someone to tell
me that the path I chose wasn't[A]
a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I understand now.[A]
I chose to turn against my country...
And I won't regret that decision.[A]
[03F0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I've never heard of this
area before.[A]
I never knew there was a
place like this in Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]This is a land that people have
long forgotten.[A]
The years go by, but time just
seems to linger...[A]
It is that kind of place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you always live here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
Before I settled here, I used
to travel around the world,[A]
living by the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...
Have you been to Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Once, in the past.[A]
[03F1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]The Sword Saint...[A]
Have you heard of this
legendary figure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My mother used to tell me stories
about him.[A]
When I was still very young, a
large group of bandits attackedNL
[03F2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Master Karel...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I should tell you the
truth.[A]
Keeping silent to cover up one's
shame would be stepping off the[A]
path of the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shame?
You saved my village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
I never thought about saving the
Village.[A]
I just wanted to kill.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was like a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.[A]
I was aimlessly wandering around
looking for people to satisfy my[A]
lust for blood.[A]
As long as I could cut, as long
as I could kill, it didn't[A]
matter who it was.[A]
...Even if it were an infant in a
village I happened to stop by at.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...[A]
But it is a false name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]But...[A]
I can't imagine that what you
[ToggleSmile]say is true when I look at[A]
you now.[A]
You, standing before me now,
is the Sword Saint that I had[A]
always pictured in my mind.[A]
What...
What happened...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Some things you will realize only
after you have lost something else.[A]
However, by the time that my
foolishness had left me...[A]
It was already too late.[A]
[03F3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiir!
Where are you?[A]
Fiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiiiiir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]F-Father...
You are much too loud.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir!
It's good to see you safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's been a while since we
last met.[A]
I was getting worried that
we might not be able to see[A]
each other ever again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't exaggerate, Father...[A]
We were together during our
marches.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But we don't have many chances where
we can speak in private like this.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now come, Fir.[A]
You can tell your father anything
that's on your mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]F-Father...[A]
I'm sorry, but I have
instructions from Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you?
Then I shall accompany you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, but I must fulfill
my tasks on my own, otherwise it[A]
wouldn't be training.[A]
I must be off now.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hum...
Be careful, my daughter.[A]
[03F4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiiir![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiiiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Where are you, my daughter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]F-Father...[A]
You don't have to shout
so loudly...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been hearing some troubling
rumors, Fir.[A]
I hear that you are secretly seeing
this man in the army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it true, my daughter?
But fear not![A]
I shall crush any bad influences
that may advance upon you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No, you don't understand![A]
[OpenMidLeft]He's helping me with my training.
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, so you were looking for someone
to hone your skills with.[A]
But no worries, my daughter.
You have your father to spar with![A]
Now come,
charge at me with full force![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
I appreciate your consideration,
but it needs to be someone who[A]
can use a sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorryFather...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hum...[A]
Take care of yourself,
my daughter.[A]
[03F5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fi-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]I can hear you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Fir.
You were all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father!
Enough is enough![A]
I'll be quite fine on my own!
I don't need your overprotection![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Forgive me.
I was wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Forgive me, my daughter...[A]
I just wanted to make up for
our lost time together.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lost...time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
When you were still a little girl,
both your mother and I were always[A]
training.[A]
I regret now that we didn't pay
enough attention to you.[A]
You never knew your parents'
warmth and protection...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you grew up to be a strong,
confident young woman.[A]
However, that isn't thanks to me.[A]
So I just wanted to be able to
help you anyway I could...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father...
You were always kind and loving.[A]
Whenever I was about to fall
apart, you held me in your[A]
strong arms and comforted me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Father...
I was happy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fir...
Oh, my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]F-Father![A]
Please don't cry in a place
like this![A]
[03F6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah,
I have something to ask of you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want you to
spar with me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
For your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I must experience all sorts
of swordplay to master the art.[A]
You taught me about fighting at
the Arena that time, and...[A]
I would truly appreciate it if
You would train me for a while.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you say so.
It's fine with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Thank you![A]
Let's start now, then...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Wha-!?[MoveMidRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Are you okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes!
I'm sorry![A]
I'll get away now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not like you to
trip like that.[A]
Are you hurt?
Let me see your knee...[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No, I'm...f-fine!
We must get on with the duel![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you really okay?
You don't seem quite...well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-We fight![A]
[03F7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Are you okay?[A]
You should tell me if
you're not feeling well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You look like
you have a fever...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-It's nothing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...
Your face looks red.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's nothing![A]
It's just that I'm in a
little slump right now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir?
Is something on your mind?[A]
If you need someone to talk to,
I'd be happy to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah!
This might sound rude, but..[A]
D-Don't talk to me anymore![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft]......
...Fir.[A]
[03F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait, Fir!
Don't go.[A]
I need to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I...[A]
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.[A]
But...[A]
I find my mind wandering, and
I'm always thinking about you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir...[A]
[OpenMidRight]G-Goodbye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]Wha-...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you remember
the first time we met?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.[A]
But I couldn't muster up the guts
to do so.[A]
Even after we said goodbye to each
other, I've been regretting that I[A]
didn't tell you how I felt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I honestly thought it was a miracle
when we met on that island.[A]
And...[A]
Although I've been keeping it in
until now, I won't hesitate anymore.[A]
I have to tell you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir,
I...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]I love you.[A]
[03F9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Um.....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, excuse me,
are you Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering if you would spar
with me, if we get the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I've also been training my sword
skills, and I've won at many arenas[A]
around the continent.[A]
You don't have to go easy on me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I refuse.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Is it because I'm a woman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...When I swing my sword,
I do so to kill people.[A]
I have no interest in using
my sword for play.[A]
[OpenMidRight]! Play!?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]W-Wait...![A][Clear]
...He thought that I was playing
with my sword?[A]
I wanted to learn from him because
his blade is so sharp and he has[A]
no hesitation at all...[A]
[03FA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger!
We fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Get out of my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I will not move until you understand
that I am serious.[A]
Draw your sword![A]
I have been serious about training
my skills, and I will not allow you[A]
to say that it is simply for play.[A]
And I want to become stronger,
so I want to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I told you that I use
my sword to kill others.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
But my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I draw my blade here,
you will die.[A]
Is that your wish?[A]
[OpenMidRight]! ...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you have no intention of
killing me, either, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's why I say you're
just playing around.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...I just...[A]
...But maybe I was being rude,
I should apologize when I see[A]
him next.[A]
[03FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
Wait, please don't glare at
me like that...[A]
I'm not here to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]But your skills are indeed impressive.
I still see you as a goal to reach.[A]
I wish I could be as strong as you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Just be yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My blade is covered with blood.[A]
There is no need to see your goal
in that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Someone once told me...[A]
'All paths of the sword lead to
one place.'[A]
I still have yet to find out if
that is true or not, but I can[A]
say that your sword is definitely
on some kind of path.[A]
But I still have much to learn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Think what you will.[A]

[03FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see you haven't lost
your skill.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Rutger...[A]I keep telling you not to suddenly[A]
pop up and attack from behind![A]
Geez, I'd never have enough lives
if I had to put up with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
It is already decided that I am the
first one to land a blow on your back.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, obviously we were out to kill
each other when we were on different sides.[A]
But why the hell are you trying to slice
me in half when we're on the same side?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others bore me.[A]I need someone of your strength
to duel with.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So I'm gonna get killed because
you're bored.[A]
Wonderful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure...[A]
As if you've ever let my sword
touch you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you think!
I want to live too, you know![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll get you next time
for sure.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Geez...[A]
[03FD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Hey!
I thought I told you to stop that![A]
Persistent, aren't you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?
You seem to be in a bad mood.[A]
Did something happen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Lemme guess...[A]
You found a personal enemy in
Bern's ranks?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenMidRight]Guess I hit the spot.[A]
Then how come you're taking it
out on me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I saw the soldier who led the
attack on my hometown, Bulgar.[A]
But when I reached him...
he was already dead.[A]
It was you, Dieck.[A]
Those swords marks...it had
to be you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Sorry.[A]
Had I known, I would have left him
to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This is a battlefield.
Enemies don't belong to anybody.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...
Can't you relax a little more?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You can't rush through life...[A]
[03FE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm having trouble sleeping.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the leader of the Bulgar
attack you saw the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.
Well...maybe.[A]
Even after I see him dead, my
nightmares still persist.[A]
At that attack...
They left only me alive...[A]
The reason was because I...
didn't look like a Sacae native.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tough to kill someone with the
same colored skin.[A]
But you do have Sacaen blood in[A]
you, don't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
My father's mother and my mother's
father were Sacaean.[A]
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so there
are a lot of mixed people there.[A]
But usually the Sacaean side is
stronger in mixed children's[A]
in mixed children's appearances.[A]
But I...[A]
Only in me did the Bern side come
come out more, so I was kept alive...[A]
The people of Bulgar...they were
kind to me, even though I looked[A]
different...[A]
But they...they were killed,
so brutally![A]
I must destroy Bern...![A]
That one man isn't enough to
satisfy my revenge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought you had some kind of,
burden, but now I see it clearly...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I guess I'll go along
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have no need for sympathy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Come on, you know how strong I
am, right?[A]
If you really want to take on Bern,
there's no better ally than me.[A]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Suit yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And so I will.
Well then, let's go, partner![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dieck...
I'm sorry.[A]
[03FF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yo, Ward.
Come here for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Eh?
Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pay more attention to what's
going on around you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You could have nine lives, and it
still wouldn't be enough, the way[A]
you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Bro, I'm still alive.
With my strength, I can crush[A]
anything that crosses my path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The idiots who said that in the
past all got killed early on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry me so much.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Got it?
Good.[A]
You don't have to go all out
all the time.[A]
[0400]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bro!
Did you see me just now!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I took on 3 guys with one
swing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you even remember what I
told you before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?
Um...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Attack?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No![A]
I told you to pay more attention
to what's going on around you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Bro, fighting like that just
doesn't sit well with me.[A]
I'm getting stronger, too.[A]
I'll get strong enough so I can
crush anything that comes at me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...That kid can't sit still,
can he.[A]
[0401]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bro...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry, you win.[A]
The other day I almost got killed, and
then I remembered what you told me.[A]
Maybe I was getting carried away...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So after that, I've been
following your advice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that you have, 'cause
you're still alive.[A]
If you can pay attention to the
bigger picture, you won't get[A]
killed so easy.[A]
With your strength, you can
impress people without always[A]
rushing in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bro, you okay?
You're like, praising me.[A]
It feels...weird.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, shut up.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[0402]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bro, what do you think
about our employer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That kid, Roy?[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I like him.[A]
He's pretty impressive for one
so young.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, he is.[A]
But...
He's young.[A]
Too young.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I guess you're right,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand why you support him.[A]
He's a nice guy, and he's got
brains and guts.[A]
But...
The battles now are still easy.[A]
When he gets to a battle, in a
life or death situation...[A]
That's when we see how he really
is...[A] 
[0403]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Years ago...when I just became a
mercenary...[A]
I was only concerned about
spreading my fame...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really...
You had such times, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our squad was sent right in the
middle of the enemy lines.[A]
We were supposed to go deep into
Bern and kill the enemy leader.[A]
We waited underground for days...
and then the time came.[A]
And when we went out...dozens of
rained down on us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our employer...[A]
He purposely put us there so he
could buy time for himself to escape.[A]
Our squad was decimated.
They killed us all.[A]
All except for me.[A]
I was kept alive for torturing
purposes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We mercenaries are simply disposables
in their eyes.[A]
That's the norm.[A]
If you don't think like that, you won't
be able to take it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...that kid, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...he's different.
If I'd only known him before...[A]
[0404]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight]So...[A]
Looks like we're both still
alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Funny, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're mercenaries.[A]
We don't give a who wins, all
We care about are our money and[A]
our lives.[A]
We're best to just walk off
rather than stay and get killed.[A]
But...it's weird.[A]
We're going through all of these
incredibly tough battles, and I[A]
still don't feel like running
off.[A]
Roy...he makes me feel like I
can fight and die for his purpose[A]
and not have any regrets.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
I feel that way too.[A]
[0405]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Captain![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, please.
Not 'Captain'.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[A]
Back in Ilia, we always call
our leader the captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't suit me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, um...[A]
Okay, then I'll call you
Bro, like Lott and Ward do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, can't use that,
either?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just call me Dieck,
like you always have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
I feel left out when they call
Bro and I just call you Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey wait!
Dieck![A]
[0406]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Thany, I see you fighting on
your own a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
I'm on a pegasus, see?
I have a different movement pace
than the others, so it's easier[A]
to fight on my own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right then, I want you to
slow down your pace from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
But I'm doing fine on my own![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Everyone gets worried when you
just go charging in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But if I get stronger...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can you stand up against a legion
in the thousands?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, no.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then make sure you match your pace with
the others, to make sure we can win.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To make sure we can win, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wars aren't fought alone,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0407]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Dieck![A]
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
But you shouldn't trust them
too much, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
That's different than what you
were saying before![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What I said was a guideline for
fighting.[A]
What I'm saying now is a guideline
for a mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]For a mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A mercenary has to fend for himself.
No one's gonna be looking out for you.[A]
You've got to be skeptical.[A]
You should even be wary that I might
be giving out orders just so I can[A]
ensure my own safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not a problem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You wouldn't be thinking things
like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You never know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.
So do Lott and Ward.[A]
That's why we can entrust our
lives to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't get cocky, kid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee...[A]
[0408]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Oujay![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L-Lady Lilina![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't act so tense like that...[A]
I just wanted to talk to some people
from Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...all right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Talk to me.
Let's see...[A]
Tell me about your hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My hometown?[A]
Well...
It was just an ordinary village.[A]
We were poor...[A]The reason I came all the way
out to the city was to make money[A]
to feed my younger brothers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have brothers?
How nice.[A]
Do you have any sisters?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I have one sister who's a
little younger than me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
What's she like?[A]
Is she cute?
Does she look like you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I...I was still young, so I don't
really remember.[A]
But I remember holding her hand.[A]
Her hand...it was so small and
delicate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's so sweet...[A]
I've always wanted a younger
sister, too.[A]
[0409]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Oujay, how is your sister
doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Is she at home?[A]
Or did she come to Ostia with
you?[A]
If she did, I would like to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Lady Lilina,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me.
I'd love to meet her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]......
She's not around anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina...[A]
Our village was very poor.
...It is the men who become work hands.[A]
Girls...have no place.[A]
We don't have any extra bread, either,
so...[A]
When a girl is born in a poor family,
we put pretty clothes on her and[A]
leave her in a faraway town.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We were poor.[A]
I don't hold anything against
my family.[A]
If we hadn't done what we did...
we would have just starved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
I...didn't know anything...[A]
I didn't know anything...
and I...I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Don't cry!
Please, Lady Lilina...[A]
[040A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, about the other day...
I'm sorry.[A]
I said more than I should have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, I was so stupid.
But I don't want to stay ignorant.[A]
Right now I don't know anything
running a country, but I'll learn.[A]
I shall make Ostia a country in
which our children can always[A]
be happy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lady Lilina, please don't
strain yourself.[A]
My brothers are doing fine
thanks to the Ostian marquess.[A]
Even God can't save all
of the people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...[A]
My sister, wherever she is...[A]
She would have liked you very much.[A]
[040B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Hmm...
I need to work on my twirls more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!?[A]
Hey!
You saw my secret training![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
I didn't mean to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter![A]
I can't let you go back alive,
now that you've seen me.[A]
For an entertainer, being seen
practicing a trick means death![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D-Death?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, was that right?
Anyway, it's that embarrassing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
Well, I guess what's done is done.[A]
Hey, if you saw my dance, you might
as well tell me how it was![A]
What did you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uhm...
Well, it was really pretty.[A]
Although it was a little...
revealing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
You know, this dance's main part
is still to come.[A]
It becomes really amazing towards
the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow...it does?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][A]
Hey![A]
You were thinking naughty thoughts,
weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No no!
I wasn't![A]
[040C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]Hmm~~~[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Oh, you're that guy who was
who was spying on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That's a misunderstanding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you praised my dancing,
so I'll forgive you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You really like to dance,
huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess.
It's fun.[A]
I meet a lot of people when I
travel around, and they all[A]
love my dancing.
That sort of thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, I know.[A]
Do you want me to show you the rest
of the dance from the other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you want to see it?
You do, right?[A]
Then tell me that you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I... I want to see it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah well, I guess I can show it
to you.[A]
This is the sixth of the seven
dances I've mastered so far.[A]
And it's called...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's called...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dance Number 6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.
It's kind of...ordinary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were disappointed just now,
weren't you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No!
I wasn't.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you were.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I wasn't![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, sure![A]
Nope, changed my mind.
I won't show it to you![A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No...[A]
[040D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
Oh, I know.[A]
You just wanted to see that dance
so badly, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your dancing...[A]
I think I have seen it
somewhere before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
You have?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
A small band of entertainers once
stopped by my village when I was[A]
younger.[A]
I went to watch them...and a
little girl was dancing in the[A]
center.[A]
She tripped a few times and made
some mistakes, but she was trying[A]
really hard.[A]
I was going through some tough
times back then, but that girl's[A]
dancing kind of cheered me up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
I don't remember it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.[A]
You're probably cheering up
a lot of people with your[A]
dancing, where ever you go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Oujay.[A]
Tell you what.[A]
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Special...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's really amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow...it is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were thinking naughty
thoughts again, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
I wasn't![A]
[040E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Oh...
Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Damn...
So it's you, eh?[A]
I'm telling you, I'm not going
to be your friend or anything...[A]
...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You had an expensive-looking
bracelet on your wrist.[A]
Where'd it go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You have keen eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you hafta be alert when
you're doing banditry.[A]
Did you take it off or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I gave it away.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Gave it away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I met an old blind man on the
way here.[A]
He said that he would starve,
so I gave it to him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh man!
You princesses are so damn gullible![A]
He's obviously tricking you.[A]
He's making you pity him so that
you'll give him money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...
Maybe he's telling the truth...[A]
Listen kid, there's no way in hell
that he's telling the truth.[A]
After he gets his money, he'll be
laughing at you as you walk away.[A]
You're soft 'cause you don't
know the real world.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Well...[A]
I mean, it's your bracelet, so you
can do whatever you want with it...[A]

[040F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
I told you before, I ain't
your friend.[A]
There's no telling what'll happen
to you if you stay with me so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.
You're a good person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha!
Would you listen to that![A]
You really think you can tell
good from bad in the real world?[A]
Even after you were so easily
tricked the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm here for the money.[A]
And if I don't make any, I'll
just go back to being a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...In that case, why don't
you just attack me right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have magic tomes, ribbons...
a lot of expensive items.[A]
You can sell them all for money.
Right now, there's no one around...[A]
You should just take all my[A]
belongings and run off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...If you understand that much,
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]then why are you talking to me?[A]
What if I really did do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you did...then it would be my
foolishness.
But I don't think that you would
do something like that.[A]
I just feel that you're not a bad
person.[A]
I...trust you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Dammit![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]How could I do anything with her
looking at me like that...[A]
[0410]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
You said you gave your bracelet
to that blind guy, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What would you do if you met
him again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I guess I don't have to ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would get tricked just as
easily as you did before and[A]
do anything for him, I assume.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Why do you care so much for
total strangers?[A]
What are you gonna get from
helping them?[A]
You should just ignore them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...If I see someone in need, I
would feel that I want to do[A]
something to help him.[A]
If I met that old man again,
I would probably give him[A]
him something...again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Oh well, I guess some
people are just born stupid.[A][Clear]
Oh yeah...
I have to give you this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[ToggleSmile]?
What is this?[A]
It's beautiful...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dunno.[A]
Some old guy who said he'd met
you came up to me the other day.[A]
He asked me to give you this.[A]
He also said that he was really
grateful for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...
I met that old man way back in...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I don't know![A]
Anyway, he wanted me to give
this to you.[A]
Just take it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Garret...[A]
[0411]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey, you're a sailor,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Yeah, I am.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do sailors make a lot
of money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well, we used to.
But now...it's not so good.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I had to stoop down to piracy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Sorry to bother you, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
I thought you wanted something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking you might hire me
on your ship, but it's kinda[A]
stupid to go from a bandit to
being a pirate.[A]
I just...don't want to rob people
to live anymore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.[A]
It doesn't suit me anyway.[A]
I'm going back to being a trader
after the war ends.[A]
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.[A]
[0412]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Garret.[A]
Try spinning around in the spot
a few times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What kind of joke is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just think of it as a sailor's
test.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Damn.
Fine.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove].........[ToggleMouthMove]
All right, I did it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Now try walking straight over
here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[MoveRight][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Whoa.[MoveRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're gonna get seasick.[A]
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a seafarer.[A]
[OpenRight]What?
A grown man, seasick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't make a difference.[A]
Even grown men puke their guts
out when they're still not used[A]
to the rocking of the ship.[A]
And the outer seas can be nasty.[A]
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip the ship over.[A]
Well, I suppose you'll get[A]
used to it after a month or so.[A]
[OpenRight]A month?[A]
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
The oceans' huge.[A]
We sometimes won't see land
for an entire year.[A]
[OpenRight]Whoa...[A]
Maybe I don't want to do
this after all.[A]
[0413]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it.[A]
Sailing seems like a worse
option whenever I hear about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You think so?
The sea's a great place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you're always on the water,
right?[A]
It's just endlessly blue[A]
wherever you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's true.[A]
When the sun comes up in the east...
or when it sets in the west...[A]
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Dawn is great as well,
but I prefer the sunset.[A]
When you're sailing towards
the setting sun, it's just...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you can't make any
money with the sunset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You have no aesthetic sense.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All right, I'll let you on my
ship sometime.[A]
You can't call yourself a true
sailor until you see that beauty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't going to
make me any money...[A]
[0414]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eeeeeeek!
A bandit![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yup, I'm a bandit.
Got a problem?[A]
...Hey, I was wondering...
Do entertainers make a lot of money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't be doing banditry forever.[A]
I've been looking for a job that
would make me a decent amount[A]
of money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I don't know if we make a lot
of money, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, do you think there's
some kind of entertainment that[A]
I can do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
What I know best is dancing,
so...[A]
Perhaps there's one that
you could do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There is?
Teach me, please![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
All right.[A]
I'll teach you next time.
[CloseSpeechFast]See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm counting on you...[A]
[0415]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]No no!
You've got it all wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-What?
It was like this, right?[A]
You step like this, and
then you twirl...[A]
Am I doing something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just doing the moves isn't enough.
You have to have charm.[A]
With an expression like that,
everyone'll run screaming.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shut up![A]
This is the face I was
born with![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...?
Talking back, are we?[A]
Fine, then.[A]
I won't teach you anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...O-Okay...
Charm, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have to always be smiling.[A]
Come on, give it a try.
Let's see a smile...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Smile...
All right...[A]
......[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hahahahaha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What're you laughing at!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay, what more do you need...
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know.[A]
You don't look sexy enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sexy!?
Look, I'm a guy.[A]
Can't you imagine how creepy I'd
look if I tried to be sexy with[A]
this face?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...?
Talking back again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, all right!
I'll do it.[A]
I'll do anything you say!
Here...how's that?[A]
Do I look sexy enough now!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good!
You're doing well.[A]
Hahahahahaha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I swear, she's just
playing with me...[A]
[0416]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were just making fun of me,
weren't you![A]
You were teaching me how to
dance, huh?[A]
Well, that was nothing but a
load of crap![A]
When I danced in front of the
others, like you showed me, they[A]
all laughed their assess off![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Good![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What!?
Why you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look.[A]PNL
[0417]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You're a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Yeah, I am.[A]
You...Are you a thief?
Hey, do thieves...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shut up!
Don't come near me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I freaking hate bandits![A]
I feel like tearing my hair
out when I hear about them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, is that so?[A]
It's not like I care about what
you like or don't like, anyway.[A]
So you came to me just to say that?
You must have a lot of free time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...Huh.
What was that all about?[A]
[0418]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Damnit.
You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ugh, I saw a bandit.
My day is ruined now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh.[A]
Like you're any different.
You steal as well.[A]
You ain't got any right
to criticize me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha, I only steal from the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, so we're playing the
the good thief, are we?[A]
That doesn't justify...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha, maybe not.[A]
What I'm doing is theft,
I won't deny that.[A]
But...
I will say this.[A]
I'll never, ever do things like
burning villages down and hurting[A]
innocent people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Well...
Sorry.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You again?
Damnit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a bandit, like you say.[A]
I've plundered villages and killed
innocent people.[A]
But...let me say this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...I hate bandits as well...and
I hate the way I've been living[A]
like them.[A]
That's all.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.[A]
[041A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the hell!?
Are you an enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I, I...[A]
I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wasn't asking your name.
Well, I guess you ain't an enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How were you ever let into
this army?[A]
You're almost a complete opposite
of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I mean, look at what you're wearing!
You look like a total brigand.[A]
People'll be running away from you.
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well anyway,
you should learn from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Learn?[A]
You?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?
You got a problem with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No...[A]
Okay.
I learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not 'you'.[A]
I'm Master Garret.[A]
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]G...
G...?[A]
Strange name...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look at yours![A]
[041B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey.
You want something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
G...g...[A]
G...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Garret.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you that.
Here. I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Guess you aren't so useless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, my mom used to pick these in
the mountains when I was just a kid.[A]
The bittersweet seeds are the
best part![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Mom...
You have parents.[A]
I not have...[A]
I don't have any parents now, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]She was killed in a bandit attack
when I was just a kid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I survived.[A]
I found every single one of those
bandits and put them through what[A]
they did to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It took 8 years.[A][Clear]
But...now I have nothing.
I just... don't have anything else
to live for anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...
Why am I telling you this.[A]
[041C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
G...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Garret.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you that.
Here.[A]
I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa whoa...[A]
You didn't have to bring the whole
tree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well yeah, I do, but this
is going a little overboard...[A]
Ah well, who cares.
Thanks.[A]
You want some?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't eat.
I don't eat strange things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...And what's that supposed
to mean?[A]
Hm?[A]
...Looks like I better get going.
Come on, Gonzales.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[041D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You must be a Pegasus Knight
from Ilia.[A]
Pleased to meet you.
I am Alan, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Tate.
You know, do you always...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So this is a pegasus?
I've never seen one up close.[A]
It has a cute face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?
No, wait.[A]
What I was saying was, do you
always fight like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Is there something wrong with it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you think you're being
too rash?[A]
The way you fight, you never know
what'll happen to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, the way I fight can
be dangerous.[A]
But, you see...[A][Clear]
Oh, I shouldn't be chatting like
this during a battle, or I will[A]
give the enemy an advantage.[A]
I must get going.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...There's something wrong with you.[A]
[041E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have to tell you now.
Why do you fight like that?[A]
Even the way you thrust your spear...[A]
Why do you rely on brute strength
to attack?[A]
It makes it harder to evade a
retaliation that way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
I see you've been watching me
carefully.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
N-No...it's not that![A]
It's just that...[A]
How could someone miss when
you're fighting like that?[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, what I wanted to say was,
why don't you be more careful[A]
when you fight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand what you're saying.
But I can't pull back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're still saying that?
But the way you fight...[A]
[OpenMidRight]In battle, the first ones to match
blades with the enemy are us, the[A]
knights.[A]
The enemy will judge the entire
army's strength by looking at[A]
how we fight.[A]
That's why I have to show them
our power.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]If I cringe even a little, that
adds to the enemy's morale.[A]
If there is hesitation in my moment,
it will have a bad effect on the[A]
whole army...[A]
That's why I have to charge.[A]
I have to keep pushing forward,
for all of our sakes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
...I thought you were just an idiot
who couldn't do anything but charge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, but I have to fight
like this.[A]
Still, your advice was useful,
too.[A]
Give me some more when you get
the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...All right, I suppose.[A]
[041F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You haven't changed your
fighting, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long are you going to
continue fighting like that?[A]
I understand what you're saying...
But if you die, it's all over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that.[A]
There is only so much I can do
on my own.[A]
But I'm a knight, therefore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...
[ToggleSmile]Shall I stay at your side?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You would...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-If I leave someone like you alone,
I get worried and...can't concentrate![A]
So if I support you from nearby,
it'll be easier for you, too, right?[A]
Or... am I not good enough...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are![A]
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...[A]
With you around, it seems that
I can stay out of harm's way.[A]
I can trust you to guard my back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]O-Oh...[A]
But...
I'm really all right for you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course!
You're a strong warrior.[A]
You're perfect to fight
alongside with.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I meant...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So...the point is that...
I'm the one by your side...and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Nothing, forget it...
Well, come on, let's go.[A]
We have to hurry, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, let's be off![A]
[0420]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where's the next enemy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have been performing
well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, it also looks as if you are
charging into enemy lines without[A]
thinking.[A]
Your duty is to protect Master Roy.
Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
Defeating the enemy leads to
Master Roy's safety![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What if during your fighting,
Master Roy were to be hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That hasn't happened so far...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does that mean it won't happen
at all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...what must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take your time in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take my time...?[A]
[0421]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alan.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I need you to teach me something...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Teach?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said to take my time in battle.[A]
Then was my fighting style up until
now wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
But you only use the one style
of fighting you are used to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just one...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your courage is not a bad thing.
Rather, it should be praised.[A]
However, I am worried that you might
go berserk and go rushing in, leaving[A]
Master Roy behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A true knight must think about what
he must do at a given moment and[A]
change his style accordingly.[A]
Charging is not always the best way.[A]
[0422]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Alan, your fighting has
been impressive lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am trying my best to change my
fighting style, as you told me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Hm, you seem able enough to
take over after me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am old.[A]
I must make way for the young
generation, for Roy.[A]
I want you to take care of Roy
in my place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-Me...?[A]
Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course not!
It is an honor![A]
I shall protect Master Roy with my life
and bring further prosperity to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm down.
I told you that your fire worried me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need to get all worked up.
Master Roy is still young.[A]
You must grow with him, as a
knight, and as a person.[A]
[0423]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance!
How fares your sword today?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Neither good nor bad,
Alan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cool and calm as always,
I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The other day, I lagged behind
you, but not in this battle![A]
Watch and learn from my skill,
Lance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I'll watch you fight.[A]
Still, I have no intention of
losing to you from now on, either![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well well, what confidence![A]
I look forward to seeing you
after the battle.[A]
Well then, I'll be off.
You'd better come quickly too.[A]
[0424]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alan, the battles will only get
tougher from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
But it's just what I want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alan, I need to tell you something.
It's about when we lose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When we lose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.[A]
...If it looks like defeat would
be certain, you to take Master[A]
Roy and retreat.[A]
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy time for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
But then you would be in danger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone has to do it.[A]
Then it might as well be me, who
has been in Pherae the shortest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you're staying, then I will
as well.[A]
I won't allow you to go off alone
and commit suicide.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of a long line of
knights serving the Pherae family.[A]
So you should take Master Roy
and flee...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long you've served means nothing![A]
Then let me ask you this.[A]
Has your loyalty been less than the
other knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Can't say it yourself?
Then I'll answer for you.[A]
You're working just as hard as anybody![A]
You've been as loyal as any of the
other knights![A]
I know that best, because I've been your
partner ever since you came to Pherae![A]
[OpenMidRight]Alan...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't do anything stupid, Lance.[A]
You're a necessary person to both
us and to Master Roy.[A]
[0425]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Alan, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean about when we lose?[A]
Are you still saying that you're
going to sacrifice yourself,[A]
or something ludicrous like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I gave up that idea.[A]
...Your words were a slap in the face,
so to speak.[A]
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've been in Pherae the shortest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.
Except me, of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?
I really envy you sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course I have confidence.
How could I possibly lose to you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You'd better remember those words, for
you will be hearing them again from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha, never![A]
See you after the battle![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Even if we lose, you won't be the only one
staying behind and fighting to buy time![A]
You'd better remember that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
[0426]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're Ward, the mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Alan, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
You're one of our client's knights.[A]
Hey...
Are you a strong fighter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Talk about being sudden...[A]Well, I can say I consider myself
to be fairly skilled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, good.
You want to have a duel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.[A]
But I'm telling you now, I can't
go easy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would kill you if you do.[A]You'd better not be complaining
if you get hurt, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...let's go![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E]
[OpenMidLeft]W...Whoa...
You're better than I thought...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You too...
Good fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen up,
next time I'll beat you.[A]
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
Sure thing![A]
[0427]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight]Hey you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward!
How do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been looking for you.
Let's continue.[A]
We didn't finish the other day's
duel yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
I thought I won that match.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No way, I was just getting warmed up.
You haven't seen the real me yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh no?
[ToggleSmile]Then I shall go full force too![A]
[OpenMidRight]Bring it on![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E]
[OpenMidLeft]Damn...
You are strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're even now...
Lance and I used to spar like this a lot.[A]
It's a great thing to have a partner
you can train with to see how much[A]
you've grown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I haven't lost yet![A]
I'm really going all out next
time, you hear?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
I'll take you on any time![A]
[0428]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Aaaarrr![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...![A]
[ToggleSmile]You're...getting better, Ward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Y...You too![A]
You become stronger every time
I see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm still weak.
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heh, then I'll become stronger
than that![A]
No matter how many enemies come out,
I'll crush them all with my axe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Enemies...[A]
Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, how?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think we can win?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
Of course we'll win.[A]
I'm on this side, after all.[A]
How could we lose?
And we've also got you.[A]
No enemy would stand a chance
against the two of us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Haha...
That's right, I forgot.[A]
There's no way we could lose.[A]
It isn't like me at all to get
worried like that.[A]
All right!
Charge![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh yeah!
Let's go get 'em![A]
[0429]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Lance, have you gotten used to
the Pherae family yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Sir Marcus.[A]
Everyone has been very good
to me, who is an outsider...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
Good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have been very caring as
well, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must have you work
especially hard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Especially?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have something that the other
knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I do...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
And that will help Master Roy
in the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[042A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said before that I had something
that the other knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]However, I cannot see what that
something is.[A]
I am but an ordinary knight.[A]
I think you see more in me than
there actually is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I was in a different band of knights
up until recently, so I have no idea what[A]
I can do for Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There, you have it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have experience in other areas.
The others do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy will take Pherae's throne
in the future.[A]
And if only Pheraens are around him,
he will grow to be a person with[A]
limited views.[A]
We need someone like you who knows
knows other parts of the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Will my experience...
be of use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must make it so.[A]
Master Roy must grow to be an individual
with diverse beliefs.[A]
[042B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy was telling me the other day
that you were telling him stories of[A]
other parts of the continent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If my experience can be of use to Master
Roy, then I shall do my best to teach him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Well, it seems that I can now
Retire without any worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not if we have you.[A]
You can take my place once
I am gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?
But I am not a native of Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still worrying yourself over
matters like that?[A]
Master Roy certainly isn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...All right, then I shall take your
place when the time comes.[A]
But that is in the far future.[A]
You are still well, and you must
still be our example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe I can.
One never knows.[A]
[042C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are Lott, the mercenary.
An axe-fighter with much endurance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...You're Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seemed to have a troubled
look on your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
I was just thinking some things over.
Actually, this is perfect.[A]
Let me ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is something within my
meager knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, axes are weak against
swords.[A]
This is just common sense.[A]
What I'm wondering about is why
it became like that.[A]
I just don't get the evidence
or physics behind it.[A]
That's what I was thinking about.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Sometime earlier, I asked the same
exact question as you.[A]
I think I've found the answer after
I looked through several books on[A]
war strategy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So is it...
the weapon's weight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
Because all weapons are designed bearing
in mind that humans will be wielding them,[A]
it is almost inevitable that minor flaws
and weaknesses would not appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
It's impossible for a weapon
to just make you really strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
In the past, many kinds of weapons
were made, and disappeared.[A]
Among them, the sword, axe, and
spear remained, thus creating what[A]
is commonly known as the weapon
triangle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
But wait, what about weapons like
the Swordreaver?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that brings us to a
whole different dimension.[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidRight]..,Ah, I see...
Then what about...[A]
[042D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Knight to F6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Armor Knight to E3.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pegasus Knight to D1.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
Archer to B1.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Swordmaster to F1.[A]
Check.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You win.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think the mistake was when
I moved that ballista 6 turns ago?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]
Where did you learn how to play?[A]
I learned it as one of the
requirements of a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's an old war veteran living
where I come from.[A]
I couldn't find anyone to play in
the mercenary groups.[A]
But up against those who can play, it
looks like I don't stand a chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if you can point our your
mistakes, that shows you have skill.[A]
I played with Alan the other day,
but it was over in 2 turns.[A]
[042E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think we stand
a chance of winning?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I honestly don't know.
Well, we are outnumbered severely.[A]
The enemy can afford to send out new
troops all the time, while we have[A]
to be careful about losing even
one troop.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
Our starting conditions are just
so different.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Master Roy sometimes thinks of plans
that are beyond my petty thoughts.[A]
He has done miraculously well
in the battles so far.[A]
Under his direction, I feel like
we could never lose.[A]
Master Roy will surely lead
us to victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
... You're not the one to favor
somebody just because he's your master.[A]
So if you say so, it must be true.
Then I better start believing, too...[A]
[ToggleSmile]In our victory, and our leader.[A]
[042F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cecilia.[A]
Are your wounds all healed now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
I managed to survive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
...I'm sorry.[A]
I was there with you, but I
couldn't go to your aid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, you only did what
you were supposed to do.[A]
Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you for saying that...[A]
I plan on making up for it with
my work here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[0430]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,
Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That village we just passed...
It was ruined.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, it was.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably most areas of this continent
look like that due to the war.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We must put an end
to this conflict...[A]
So we can help those who
cannot defend themselves...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[0431]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia?
You look troubled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Percival...[A]
I was just wondering what will
become of Etruria after all this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just what you would think.[A]
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria will regain its former glory.[A]
It will become even more prosperous
than ever before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
We will make it happen with our
own hands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.[A]
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
You're right, Percival.[A]
[0432]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]Lord Percival, if I may have
a moment of your time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
Your Highness...!
Please do not address me as...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hush![A]
We do not know where enemies
may be hiding.[A]
Here, I am but a simple bard.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
...What is it that you need,
Elphin?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain of Etruria passed
away last year.[A]
I would appreciate if you could
inform me of the behavior of the[A]
Etrurian Courts.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Very well.[A]
After Prince Mildain passed away...[A]
[0433]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pr-...I mean, Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Lord Percival?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I hear your father is still alive.
Have you seen him recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, we have not seen each
other for several years now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you no intention of
seeing him at all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At least not until
this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
Perhaps your father is mourning for
you, thinking you are long dead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I let my father know of my safety,
other people will find out as well.[A]
I may be able to make my father
happy for a moment, but he will soon[A]
suffer the grief of losing me again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I must eliminate what is causing
that grief.[A]
Only then will I go see my father.[A]
[0434]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin.[A]
You were talking about your
songs for your future travels...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About the state of Etruria
after the prince passed away?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Will you be singing it in various
lands after the war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is what I intend to do.[A]
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course I will be.[A]
I expect my stay at Etruria to
be the longest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where will you go after you
visit the palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nowhere...[A]
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria for as long as[A]
I live.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do I have your word on that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I shall swear my honor on it.[A]
[0435]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're...
Lalam, if I recall correctly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look, look![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Watch me dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Well?
How was it?[A]
Did it grasp you?[A]
I think this twirl really does
the trick...[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
You always seem so carefree...[A]
Or rather, should I say...
disoriented?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Aww...
Are you praising me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0436]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]How is it this time,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Lalam.
I was wondering...[A]
Why do you always come to
show me your dancing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you enjoy seeing
me dance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To be perfectly honest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is of no worth to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove].........No worth...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...
You're so mean![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0437]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Odd...[A]
She was nothing more than a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, it seems...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]...Lonely?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Really?
Yes![A]
I knew you liked having me around![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't lie.[A]
You said it just seemed
lonely without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No,
I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew it![A]
Not even General Percival can live
without my dancing.[A]
All right, I'll come to you every
morning from now on and give you a[A]
wake-up dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.[A]
[0438]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight]Sophia, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Oh...
Igrene...Yes...[A]
I'm fine...
I'm just a little dizzy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't stress yourself if
you're not feeling well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
The outside world...
It's so big...[A]
I'm a little...excited...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you've never been
outside Arcadia.[A]
You can ask me anything...[A]
I know the outside world fairly well,
so I can explain things to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[0439]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...what is this?
I found it...on the ground...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let's see...[A]
Oh, this is a quarrel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Qua...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Quarrels are large arrows
used for ballistae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They can fire something...
so big....[A]
But...
It's strange...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Strange?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The outside people...[A]
They make such amazing weapons...and
they are much more advanced than us...[A]
But...why do they continue to fight?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]They're much...smarter than us, so...[A]
I thought they would know...that
war is pointless...[A]
...It is strange...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A][......]
you're right.
It is strange...[A]
[043A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
You seem to be in a good
mood, Sophia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I was speaking...to the other people
in the army...[A]
The outside people...
they are all kind...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...
That's nice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It would be nice...
if we could be friends...[A]
with the outside people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
But the elder told us not
to speak with outsiders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand what he's saying...[A]
The Dragons' powers could easily
destroy entire countries.[A]
If the outsiders found out,
they would surely fight over it.[A]
I've seen many conflicts like
that in my life...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But...someday...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
If we can live together with
Dragons, there should be no[A]
reason why the outsiders can't...[A]
[043B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...![A]
Is it...
Is it really you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoa, what the?
What's going on?[A]
I'm Astol.
Just a measly thief.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You look like him...[A]
You look so much like...
my husband...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your husband?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I lived with my husband in Arcadia.[A]
...That is, until he suddenly left
without saying a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh.
And he looks exactly like me?[A]
Well, they say that there are at
least 3 people on the continent[A]
with the same face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Let me see your leg.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey hey,
what're you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When I first met him, I found him
collapsed in the desert.[A]
The heat got to him, and he lost
memory of his past.[A]
He had blade wounds all over his body,
but he had a particularly bad injury[A]
on his leg.[A]
It never fully healed, and it left
left a scar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm not your man.[A]
My legs are clean, I don't have a scary
looking scar like that on either of them.[A]
Well, I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[043C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you...
Are you really not him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nope.
But hey, I can't believe this guy.[A]
He must be a real dastard to dump
such a beautiful woman like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Please, let me tell you
about him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]As I was treating his wounds,
we started living together.[A]
We lived happily for several years.[A]
Slowly, his memory started returning
started returning to him.[A]
I was happy about it, but I was
also...scared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.[A]
My husband left to fend them off,
and never came back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.[A]
I couldn't find my husband, so I
thought he had followed the same path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that must be what happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
I can't help thinking in the bottom of my
heart that he might be alive somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah. I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
If he were alive, he wouldn't just
disappear without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He probably wouldn't be leading such
a glamorous life anyway, even if he[A]
were alive.[A]
I say you forget about him and
move on.[A]
Hey, I know.[A]
Maybe I can give you a kiss
in place of that guy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow...[A]
Oh well...[A]
[043D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay, I suppose the rejected man
should slink away now...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Golrois...![A]
...I mean, Astol.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Please look at this...[A]
My husband was carrying it when
I first met him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are these scribbles?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're not scribbles.[A]
This is an emblem given to
Lycian spies.[A]
I also did some research on what
kind of work they do...[A]And...
I now understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information that is
incredibly dangerous to the enemy[A]
if it is leaked.[A]
If a spy gets caught, the enemy will
dig deep down into his weaknesses.[A]
Family members and lovers are taken
as hostages...[A]
And the spy is put through endless
torture until he spills every bit of[A]
information that he has.[A]
That's why spies have to be alone...[A]
They must not make family or friends,
or lovers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry to say this to you, but...
That guy is dead.[A]
He was devoured by the quicksand of
Nabata.[A]
All this stuff about spies and whatnot...
It's just your imagination.[A]
Or perhaps you saw an illusion in the
desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I...see...[A]
Then...
I must have been dreaming...[A]
I must have had a dream of
a short period of happiness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Igrene.
...No...[A][Clear]
Sorry, forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just...forget it all.
...Please.[A] 
[043E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The battle is growing bigger
all the time...[A]
Marcus, do you think Roy will
be okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, my lady.[A]
Master Roy has taken after Lord Eliwood,
who was said to be the greatest knight[A]
in Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Mr. Eliwood was a great knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lady.
And also...[A]
Lord Eliwood's wife, she was a very
kind and gentle person.[A]
Much like yourself, I might add.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...
Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy is becoming very much
like Lord Eliwood.[A]
The woman that Roy is seeking would
probably be similar to that which[A]
Lord Eliwood had found life with.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My lady, if I may suggest.[A]
When you and Master Roy return
to Pherae, then you two could...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus!
Roy and I are friends.[A]
Just friends!
Marriage...[A]
It's too soon to be thinking
of such things![A]
[043F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Marcus, what kind of couple
were Mr. Eliwood and his wife?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, my lady, when the two were
youths, that just looking at them[A]
would cheer one up.[A]
The people of Pherae were truly
happy for them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow...
That's nice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.
And one night...[A]
Before the two became engaged,
Lord Eliwood suddenly disappeared[A]
from the castle.[A]
When he returned to his live three
days later, he presented her with a[A]
beautiful white flower which only
grows in the snowy highlands.[A]
It was the flower which she
loved the most.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mr. Eliwood is so...romantic.[A]
Sigh...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Now look at Roy...[A]
[0440]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus...
What does...[A]
What does Roy think of me?
I...[A]
I'm not so sure anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, he's...[A]
I've always...liked him...
for a long time now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why not go up to him and
find out for yourself, my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not have much experience in matters
like this, but I have heard the maids[A]
at the castle saying that it is no
longer the age that women should be[A]
sitting around waiting.[A]
Lady Lilina, if you were to advance
on to him first, Master Roy would[A]
surely fall for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Yes.[A]
I'm the one who's known him
the longest.[A]
I can't lose to those
other girls![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina![A]
[0441]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Hello, Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if it isn't Lady Lilina.
You look as beautiful as ever.[A]
In fact, you're so beautiful you're
making my wrinkles fade away.[A]
See?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ashtor...you don't change, do you?[A]
My father was saying that you'd
be doing a lot better than you[A]
already are if you were more serious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, well, guess I can't
argue with that, m'lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Where did you first meet
my father?[A]
He never told me anything...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
It really ain't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was a measly thief back then.[A]
And so I decided to creep into[A]
Castle Ostia to swipe some
treasure, see?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well m'lady...[A]
...Whoops, I really shouldn't be[A]
wastin' precious time here like
this...[A]
Forgive me, m'lady, but I'll
continue the story some other time..[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
What a shame...[A]
[0442]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]...It was easy getting
to the treasure.[A]
I'm an expert at picking
locks and stuff.[A]
Anyway, after I'd grabbed all
the goodies and stepped outside[A]
the treasure chamber, bam!
There he was, standing[A]
right in front of me.[A]
And wouldn't you know,
that person was...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector just stood there,
staring at me.[A]
He didn't seem surprised
or anything. You could tell[A]
he was somebody just by looking
at him.[A]
Me? There I was, frozen in the spot,
carryin' bags of loot over[A]
both shoulders.[A]
Would he call the guards?[A]
Would he cut me down right then
and there?[A]
And I was wondering what
was coming up next...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He suddenly burst out
laughing, m'lady.[A]
He said, 'Quite a man to be able
to get through my castle's security[A]
so easily. What is your name?'
And I was just standing there,[A]
with my mouth hanging open.
Lord Hector then boomed, '[A]
Would you offer your skills
for the benefit of our country?'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought he was out
of his mind. But I knew he[A]
wasn't kidding around by looking
at his face.[A]
Anyway, I thought, to hell
with this, and I tried to[A]
bolt out the door with the treasure.[A]
And then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And then from behind me,
Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What did he do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Whoops, I'm sorry m'lady,[A]
[ToggleSmile]I really should get goin'.
I'll continue the story[A]
[OpenMidRight]Again?
Oh well...[A]
[0443]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
He didn't move an inch even when[A]
he saw I was making my escape.
So I ran.[A]
I was almost at the door, and Lord
Hector still stood there motionless.[A]
I didn't know what was going
on, and I turned around and[A]
yelled at him, 'I'm getting away!
You ain't gonna do anything!?'[A]
A heavy voice came back to me,
'Flee if you wish. You may keep[A]
the treasure as well.
But does that make you happy?[A]
Do you want to live your life
in the shadows in constant fear[A][Clear]
of being found? Is that really
what you want?'[A]
I ran like hell, m'lady. I fled
from the castle, from his voice.[A]
After that, I just walked around
the area aimlessly through the night.[A]
Dawn broke... and I found myself
in front of the castle.[A]
[Clear]
Lord Hector was standing there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Ever since then, I've been
working for him, m'lady.[A]
He changed me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So that's what happened...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina, I can say this
to anyone, at any time.[A]
Your father...
was truly an honorable man.[A]
[0444]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]So, who's next!
[ToggleSmile]...?[A]
Hey![A]
Thany![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be scurrying around
the front lines so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?
Scurrying around!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's annoying when some weakling who gets
shot down so easily by a puny archer is[A]
flying around all over the place![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah!?[A]
Well, it's a pain for me to have some
slow axefighter with no brains fighting[A]
near me as well![A]
Haven't you ever heard of the
concept of dodging?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What did you say!
You pickin' a fight with me!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're the one picking the fight![A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, even if we do fight, there's
no way that slow axe of yours is[A]
gonna reach me up here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey... Thany!
No fair![A]
Get down here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No way!
Catch me if you can, slowpoke![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Goddammit![A]
Why does she always have
to mess things up for me!?[A]
[0445]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Little early to be relaxing,
ain't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow![A]
Hey![A]
What did you do that for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There was an enemy archer
aiming at you from the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And here you are, taking it easy.
What an idiot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot?
Who's an idiot![A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone who just decides to relax during
a battle seems like an idiot to me.[A]
You're just lucky I happened to
pass by.[A]
If not, you would've been a goner
by now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
Hmph, I could easily have taken care
of a single archer.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You didn't have to put me in your
debt by saving me like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, is that so![A]
Well excuse me![A]
Fine then, I'll just be watching
From now on.[A]
Good luck![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]That idiot![A]
I couldn't thank him...[A]
[0446]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where did she go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Ward.[A]
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I told you to leave this part up
to me.[A]
That doesn't mean you just go flying
off on your own![A]
We have to listen to the leader's
orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if we sit around waiting for
orders, we could miss a big chance![A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you get it?![A]
What if you just dashed out on your
own into a bunch of enemy archers![A]
How come we always have to have people
like you who just don't think before[A]
they act...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
I thought you were angry about
me flying off on my own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![A]
We need to work as a team in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
T-That was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-W-What are you talking about![A]
N-N-No way![A]
I-I was just telling you how we
should act in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward, you're tripping over your words.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Gimme a break.[A]
That's not like you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you're right.[A]
[0447]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, who's next!
Bring it on![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ward, can't you calm down
a bit?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eh?
What's that?[A]
You scared, Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]As if![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well then, we're fine, right?[A]
I go charging in, and you cover up
the small parts for me.[A]
We've been doing great like that
all this time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mary asked me to take care
of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sis said that?[A]
Geez, I'm not a kid anymore..[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope you're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing.[A]
[0448]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight]Ward, you seem to be doing
well today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
I'm always doing great.[A]
You better do well, too, you know.[A]
You gotta make money to buy medicine
for your mother...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That's all right, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mom, she...[A]
She didn't make it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?![A]
Why didn't you tell me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If I told you, you'd be yelling at
me to go home to Myu, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think!
Myu's all alone now.[A]
Don't you care about your
own sister?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that was during a job.
I couldn't pass it up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're more stupid than I thought.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
[0449]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight]Ward, you're acting strange lately.[A]
You got something to say to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't die.[A]
You better not die.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you were killed,
what would happen to Myu?[A]
She's still just a little girl, and
she'll be forced to live on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're the same.[A]
If you were killed, Mary
would be upset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure, like that bitch
is gonna get upset over me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really don't
feel that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It's not that 'I' won't die.
'We' won't die.[A]
Eventually, we'll go home,
back to our hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's just a rundown village
with dirty rivers and no green at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it's our hometown, and
there are people waiting for us there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're right.[A]
[044A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile].....
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can tell by your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
Something tells me otherwise...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back to your
hometown after the war?[A]
If you are, I could use your help.
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help doing what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking.
You see...[A]
I have a plan to build a new village
on the Western Isles for those people[A]
who lost their homes in the war.[A]
I was wondering if you could
help out.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you me to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, lots of things.[A]
Chopping firewood, laundry, cooking..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm not a servant, you know.[A]
I'm going to live as a mercenary.[A]
Sorry, but could you ask someone
else...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So that means you'll help
us out.[A]
I knew just by looking at your
eyes that you'd understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, that's not what I said![A]
Don't put words in my mouth![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Don't lie to yourself.
You know you want to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Right, I know I don't want to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Come on, your eyes are saying
that you want to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No they're not![A]
[044B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again...[A]
I'm not helping, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trust me, you don't want to
be a mercenary.[A]
You never know when you're going
to die.[A]
And besides, you're weak.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Erg...
You'll regret saying that...[A]
You don't want to piss me off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you looking at
me like that for![A]
I once killed monsters stronger
than any human, you know![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, now that's something.[A]
What kind of beast was it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Near my village...
there's this weird cave.[A]
When I was a kid, there were rumors
rumors that the cave was filled[A]
with strange creatures.[A]
So one day I took Lot and went to
defeat them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The inside of the cave was damp...[A]
I could tell something wasn't right.[A]
Lot was scared, but I was fine.[A]
I led the way...and suddenly,
there they were.[A]
The monsters were crawling all
over the cave floor.[A]
Long, skinny bodies writhing around,
and they were all scaly and spotted..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Snakes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess they did look like snakes.
But these were no ordinary snakes.[A]
They're real monsters, with poison
and strange dances and weird moves..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...I guess.
Where is this cave?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'll go check it out on the way
way to the village site.[A]
I'm kind of curious about it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]B-But I already killed all
the monsters, so..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said they were all over
the cave floor.[A]
One might have escaped.
They're no ordinary snakes, right?[A]
I really want to see them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Erg...[A]
[044C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Well, we meet again.[A]
Well?[A]
Doesn't looking at my face make you
want to help out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But...[A]
When this war is over, it might be
a good idea to go back to my[A]
hometown.[A]
If I get bored, I might drop by
and help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have family back home?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah, I have an older sister
who's always yelling at me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
You're pretty stupid,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Stupid?[A]
What do you mean by stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got a home to return to.[A]
You've got someone waiting for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You can help us out if you want,
but you must go back home to[A]
your sister.[A]
Got it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah, you don't have to tell me...
Damn...older sister now...[A]
[044D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, don't come out front
that often.[A]
Pegasi are prey to archer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And you're frail, so make sure
you retreat if it gets dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lot!
You're such a worrier.[A]
I am a knight, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're still a knight
in training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then remember that you can
never be overly cautious in battle.[A]
The best way to stay alive
is to always be wary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Yes, sir.[A]
[044E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Thany, why do you always
go charging in like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No buts.
You know, you should be more...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Lot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]How come you're always so
concerned about me?[A]
Oh wait, I get it.[A]
Aww, I never knew you felt that
way about me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have a little sister back home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sister?[A]
Does she look like me or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's alot younger than you.
She isn't even 10 years old.[A]
So I get real worried when I'm
out here like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany, you've got an
older sister, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, not just one, but two.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then take care of yourself,
for your sister's sakes.[A]
Imagine how they'd feel
if something happened to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...you're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[044F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey, Lot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany.[A]
You seem to be doing well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See?[A]
I'm being more careful now,
right?[A]
I'm not just rushing in anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, compared to before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, just 'compared to
before', huh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something
to tell you, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
The things that you should be
careful of in battle![A]
Do you want to hear them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear
for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay...
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...[A]
Don't stress yourself
too much, big brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What the...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And that was from Lot's cute
little sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
Thany![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha![A]
[0450]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Easy, your face.[A]
All the men from that area
have features like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...They do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back home
after the war?[A]
If you are,
I could use your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.[A]
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.[A]
I want you to help build it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right,
I'll do what I can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't promise.[A]
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saying things like that already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm just saying it because
it's entirely possible.[A]
I can't be making empty promises
If I don't know whether I'll[A]
survive or not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're such a worrier
for someone so young.[A]
You'll be getting gray hairs
before you're thirty at that rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[A]
[0451]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, it's you again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the one who wanted
to build the village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right,
the plan's coming along smoothly.[A]
A free village,
open to anybody...[A]
That's my dream.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have the money to build it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, we're suddenly getting
realistic.[A]
You see...
I actually don't know.[A]
But I know of the mines in the
Western Isles, so I'm planning on[A]
going in and hitting a jackpot.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That seems pretty unrealistic to me...
...Oh, wait.[A]
I know of an old, deserted mine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I went there with Ward
when I was a kid.[A]
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ward seemed really scared,
he probably believed the rumors.[A]
We went in a little, and suddenly
Ward screamed and started running[A]
toward the entrance.[A]
So I followed him out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Was there something in there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, snakes.[A]
Lots of them.[A]
They covered the whole cave floor.[A]
I was trying to figure out why
there were snakes in there...[A]
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
So there might still be some
gold left in there.[A]
Sounds interesting.[A]
We might be able to get the money
for the village there.[A]
Say, can you take me there when
you get the chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that won't be a problem.[A]
You'll be there to protect me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Me?[A]
[0452]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, how are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I'm still alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you die.
I'm counting on you to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.[A]
And also...[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[A]
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?[A]
Well, well aren't you the lucky
man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I'm planning on going home soon,
granted that I stay alive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about that again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemy is getting stronger
all the time.[A]
I don't know how much longer I
hold out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I know that we'll win in the end...[A]
But I don't know whether I'll be
able to go home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on,
don't be so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone of your age should be
enjoying life![A]
I know you're probably worrying about
your sister and all sorts of things.[A]
But you have to go running around
more freely.[A]
You'll probably run into walls and
hit your head from time to time,[A]
but that's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't think I want to be
hitting my head.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, even if you die,
I'll take care of things for you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you can go out and get
killed without any worries![A]
...You know?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]She seemed to be saying something
different than what she was originally[A]
talking about...[A]
But...was she trying to cheer me up?[A]
[0453]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...you're Gonzales.[A]
I hear you've been doing
many evil deeds in the West.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
I want to fight with everyone.[A]
But...I useless.[A]
I become strong, everyone like me.[A]
Make me strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Very well, I shall train you.[A]
First, I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hit?[A]
I can't...[A]
You get hurt...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]Wh-Why you hit me?[A]
[OpenLeft]Did you really think that your
puny fists would hurt me!?[A]
Now hit me![A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Okay...[A]
Raaah![A]

[0454]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzales.[A]
Are you continuing with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, look.
I found this.[A]
I have more money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I become strong.
I buy armor.[A]
I not get hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]Listen![A]
Offense is everything in a battle![A]
If you kill the enemy in a single
hit, they will never get a chance[A]
to hit you![A]
Know that only weaklings wear armor![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]O-Okay...
I was wrong.[A]
I kill enemy in one hit.[A]
I buy strong axe.[A]
[OpenLeft]You...[A]
Idiot![A]
[OpenMidRight]Geh.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]So you think a strong weapon
makes you powerful, do you?[A]
A true warrior fights with
the raw strength of his muscles![A]
If you have the time to go buy
weapons, train yourself instead![A]
Train yourself to the point where
you and break down walls with the[A]
swing of an iron axe![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F]O-Okay...[A]
[0455]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Say nothing, Gonzales.[A]
I can tell by looking in your eyes.[A]
You have become strong.[A]
You have come a long way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you want to say,
Gonzales.[A]
And I completely agree with you.[A]
I'm happy that you have come
this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But it isn't over yet.[A]
The path to a true warrior is long
and hard.[A]
Now come, Gonzales.[A]
Let us go in search of further power![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[0456]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph...[A]
So this is a wyvern.
It has a forbidding face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...
Bartre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Young man, do you mind if I
touch it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, maybe not now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?
Hmm!?[A]
Why you...[A]
You want to fight me,
do you!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rubley,
stop![A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, he's on his toes
since we were training...[A]
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.[A]
Say, young man, you have quite some
talent.[A]
You've tamed this beast at your
young age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, any Dragon Knight can do
this much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't belittle yourself like that.
I can tell you have talent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes, you said
you were training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I've been trying to get some
speed in our offense.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you're already a powerful Dragon
Knight, but you seek to become[A]
even stronger?
Now that's a real man.[A]
I wish you luck.[A]
[0457]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, young man.[A]
Have you been continuing
your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, very good.
Men must always be strong in body.[A]
You know, the men these days
are getting softer and softer.[A]
Why, in battles I see grown
men lagging behind the women![A]
Disgraceful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
We must become stronger, as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I agree...[A]
You see, my daughter left home recently,
and I've been wondering that maybe I[A]
didn't enforce enough discipline on
her as a father...[A]
It's been bothering me for several
days now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, uh...
I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's always good to talk
with someone who understands![A]
[0458]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems we get along well.[A]
I feel I can bring out my true
strength when I'm fighting[A]
alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can also fight without worry
with you around.[A]
It's like...something big is
protecting me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, if I were to have a son, I would
have raised him into a fine young[A]
man like you.[A]
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From now on, think of me as your father
and feel free to tell me anything.[A]
Is that clear, son?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah...
Thank you very much.[A]
[0459]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hi, I'm Cass![A]
Hey, Bartre,[A]
can we talk for a bit?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure,
I don't mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
You look a lot like my father,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.
But he didn't act like you,[A]
though. He was nothing
but a coward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But talking to you
reminds me of him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Bartre,
can you hug me like[A]
my father used to?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, all right.
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Bartre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]Heh...[ToggleSmile]What an idiot.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Just like my father.[A]
[045A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bartre.[A]
Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?[A]
This is my axe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. And you see this[A]
other stuff? They're all yours.
I stole them from you[A]
the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yup, I'm a thief.[A]
I trick people and
steal their stuff. Well?[A]
Aren't you going to yell at me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Cath.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Why are you telling me this?[A]
You could have gotten away
with it, if you kept silent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah.[A]
I don't even know why I stole
from you in the first place.[A]
I usually only steal from
the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does it have something
to do with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe.[A]
I've always hated my father.
He was such a coward...[A]
I always hated him.[A]
[045B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Our village was burned to
the ground in the war.[A]
A bunch of soldiers came and
ordered us to set our houses on fire.[A]
No one did... I mean, who would?
It was our home. Soon the[A]
soldiers got impatient and drew
their swords... That's when one[A]
of the villagers took a torch
and went around setting the[A]
place on fire. That coward...
was my father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]All of our houses and
crops were burned... And even[A]
then, all my father did was
stand there and watch. ...[A]
I've hated him ever since.
I swore to myself that I[A]
would never become a coward
who goes around bowing to[A]
power like that. That's why I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cath... you're wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one would enjoy burning
down their own village.[A]
But your father... he had
something he needed to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.[A]
But he was fighting all the same.
He was gritting his teeth and[A]
fighting to protect something[A]
that was more important than
his house and crops. ...[A]
He was fighting to protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...... Ha...[A]
I don't think so.
My father's just a coward.[A]
[ToggleSmile]He's nothing like you.[A]
But... I suppose I could think
of it that way...[A]
[045C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Ray!
Ray![A]
[ToggleSmile]I said,
Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125]... I can hear you, you don't
have to shout like that.[A]
... What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
What are these?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Baked tarts, as you can see.[A]
The meal delivery man gave me some
extra ones.[A]
They look good, don't they?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Sweets...[A]
They're hard to get nowadays.[A]
You should savor them and
eat them for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They won't be good even
[ToggleSmile]if I eat them alone.[A]
So let's eat them later today.[A]
Anyway, I'll be going now.[A][ClearFace]
[......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
Oh, one more thing.[A]
You should at least respond when
you're spoken to![A]
With me, it's fine, but you shouldn't
act like that with strangers.[A]
People are going to misjudge you as
antisocial or something.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misjudge, huh?[A]
...Yeah, whatever.[A]
My good ol' brother seems to be
as naive as ever.[A]
[045D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was just wondering if you're
doing alright.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean,
all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was worried if you were
still here or not.[A]
You know... the first time you left,
you just left a note and suddenly[A]
disappeared.[A]
I was worried that you might just walk
off again without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your note said, 'I want to train my
Dark Magic skills on my own.[A]
Was... I in the way?
You didn't want me around...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No, that's not the case...[A]
I was planning on going back home
once I gained enough power as a[A]
Shaman.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ray!
I knew it![A]
I knew you were going to return
to pick up the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?
No, I never...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm so relieved![A]
You haven't changed at all, you're still
the kind-hearted Ray that I know.[A]
I'll go pray![A]
I'm going to thank God for letting me
see you again![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... hello?[A]
...Sigh...
Why is he like that?[A]
[045E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, I need to tell you
something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it, Ray?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I... I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.[A]
I... Uh...
I'll apologize for that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
I understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A-And![A]
I'll never disappear without
warning again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?[A]
Come on, please!![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is there a problem if
I'm near you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er...[A]
N-No, that's not the case,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
We never know how often we'll be
together once we grow up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If...[A]
If I don't make it through this war,
promise me you'll pick up the little[A]
ones at the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't say that.
We'll both survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah... you're right.[A]
Something's wrong with me today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't let you die.[A]
You're my brother, my only
brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Ray.[A]
[045F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
H-Hey[A]
You're Lugh, right?[A]
I, uh, I'm sorry for mistaking you
for your brother the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, Hugh, it's all right.[A]
We're twins, so no one can really
tell us apart anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man, thanks for forgiving me.[A]
I can't believe I just got pissed and
grabbed a kid by the collar like that.[A]
I'm a terrible man.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But originally it's Ray's fault
for walking off with your spell book.[A]
Then I have to apologize too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, never mind that.[A]
That was partly my fault for
being off-guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But... ...[A]
Yeah, you're right, never mind.[A]
We got to meet each other because
of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![A]
We're both magi, so let's help
each other along![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I was hoping that you would
teach me some things.[A]
[0460]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hugh![A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
What do you mean, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're bleeding from your
elbow![A]
We have to stop it...[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I got hit in that
last fight.[A]
Don't worry about it, it's
not such a big deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes it is![A]
You're not just going to leave
such a bad wound alone..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh?
You look a little pale, too...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I've suffered enough times already
from losing people close to me.[A]
...I will treat that wound.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......
All right, thanks.[A]
[0461]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry![A]
You said you were all right, but I
just ignored you and... I'm sure you[A]
didn't like a kid being so arrogant...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot, why are you apologizing
after helping me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you seemed to have been avoiding
me after that, so I thought that maybe[A]
you were mad...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was embarrassed, what do
you think![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because...[A]
No one ever cared for me that much in
my whole life...[A]
My grandma was the one who raised me,
but she was one hell of a bitch.[A]
I've gotten injuries far worse than
this one, but she wouldn't use her[A]
[ToggleSmile]staves to heal me at all![A]
I was just so happy that you
seemed to be so concerned..[A]
Lugh, thanks, man.[A]
You're now my friend forever.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!![A]
[0462]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
Phew... Sorry I'm straining you
so much, Trifinne... Good girl.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121]Wow![A]
A wyvern![A]
Wow, it's so big![A]
Is this wyvern yours?[A]
Will it get angry if I touch it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, go ahead.
She's a gentle one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...[A]
Wow, such hard scales...
Her fangs are sharp too![A]
Wow... are you a Dragon Knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, yes I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really!?[A]
I thought only Bern had Dragon
Knights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They say Bern's Dragon Knights are
invincible, so I was a little worried...[A]
But they'll be nothing if we have
Dragon Knights as well![A]
I want to defeat Bern, but I'm still
not very good with my magic, so I'm[A]
so I'm still not of much use yet...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Oh... I better get going.
See you later![A]
Thanks for letting me
pet your wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...see you...[A]
[0463]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Hello![A]
Can I give this to your wyvern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hello.
What is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I got some extra baked tarts, so I
wanted to give some to the wyvern[A]
as well.[A]
Oh wait, maybe wyverns don't eat
food like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You love them, right Trifinne?
Thank you, Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's called Trifinne?
Can I call her that, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here you go, Triffine.
Eat up.[A]
Good, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What is your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
I'm Lugh, from Lycia.
What's your name?[A]
Where are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm Miledy.
...I come from Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!!![......]
...You're joking, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry.
I couldn't get myself to say it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Lugh![A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]...I know it couldn't be avoided,
but still...[A]
I'm sorry, Trifinne, just when you
had made a cute friend...[A]
[0464]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Miss Miledy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry I ran off
like that the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm glad you're speaking to
me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I didn't want things to end like
that.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to my story?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four, and
ever since then I've been living at an[A]
orphanage in Lycia.[A]
It was a tiny orphanage, with seven
kids and just one priest whom we[A]
called Father.[A]
The oldest kids were my twin brother
Ray, and another boy called Chad, and[A]
me, so we three would take care of
the little ones.[A]
We were poor, but we were still
happy.[A]
But ever since Bern started the war,
our lives changed.[A]
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...[A]
Chad... he started stealing food without
telling Father...[A]
Ray then got fed up with that lifestyle
and suddenly left one day without[A]
telling anybody.[A]
I... We hated Bern.[A]
Bern was the one that did this to us...
Bern killed Father...[A]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[A]
..Anger keeps you going more than
sorrow...[A]
Anger has kept me alive... so that I would
be able to protect the little ones...[A]
...Phew...[A]
So...for now, until this war ends...
I have to keep my anger towards Bern.[A]
...But, you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I would be so relieved if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.[A]
If you would let me, I want to
help you as your friend... Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Miss Miledy.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
It's thank you.[A]
It's an expression of gratitude.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grat...?[A]

When someone does something for you
and you feel happy, you say[A]
'Thank you.'[A]

Why are you crying?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...?[A]
Do I see someone so foolish as to walk
by me without saying a word?[A]
Whoever it is, he seems to have a
death wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Oh!
H-Hey, Grandma![A]
What a coincidence![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't give me that rubbish![A]
Hiding as soon as you see me,
are you?[A]
You seem to be as shy as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, Grandma, you seem to
be all strong and healthy...[A]
You don't plan on dying any
time soon, do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph![A]
I can't be dropping dead leaving a
pathetic grandson like you on his own.[A]
And?[A]
It's been three years sent I sent you
out to study dark magic.[A]
I hope you have a good excuse for that
stench of anima magic that you're[A]
surrounding yourself with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I became a mage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Am I finally losing my hearing?
I thought I heard you say 'mage.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I said, I became an
anima magic user![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You... pathetic idiot![A]
And you dare show your face
in front of me!?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help!
Murder![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Idiot...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, where are you going,

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm going insane talking to you.[A]
You better not show me that pathetic
face of yours for a long time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I thought she was going to beat
me to a pulp.[A]
Well, either she's gotten old, or she was
just stunned at how handsome I've become.[A]
Either way, lucky me![A]

your magic.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You really are an idiot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, an idiot?
Come on, I'm your only grandson![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, unfortunately you are.
Well, there's no point in crying
over spilled milk.[A]
Anyway, I need something from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Give me back that Resire book

You don't need it anymore.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]You do have it... do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Erg...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hugh, those books are hard to get![A]
If you're telling me you sold it

[OpenMidRight]Wait!
No no no![A]
I didn't sell it![A]
I gave it away![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?
Can't you think of a better excuse?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not an excuse![A]
I met this kid who was studying dark
magic, and we traveled together for[A]
a while.[A]
I found out that the kid was an orphan,
so I kinda felt sympathetic, I guess.[A]
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the[A]
spell book![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you didn't give it away, but
you got it stolen by a child.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I guess you could put it
that way, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the only way to
put it![A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Hey, Grandma.[A]
I can leave you alone if
your head hurts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
I wouldn't be able to face your
deceased parents if I let my anger[A]
get to me and blast you to
smithereens.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
S-See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]He's just like his father...[A]
He tries to be bad, but he can't
deny his kind heart.[A]
Why couldn't he inherit his
talent for dark magic as well?[A]
[046A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandma![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I was trying to study dark
magic at first, but I couldn't[A]
seem to pick it up at all, while
that kid I was talking about was[A]
doing great just learning on his own.[A]
So I thought maybe I didn't have
the talent, so I just switched to[A]
anima magic.[A]
But the thing is, how can I not
have talent when I have your[A]
blood?[A]
So I was wondering if my old man
had the talent or not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your father had more talent with
dark magic than you could ever hope for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
That makes no sense.[A]
...Wait![A]
I got it![A]
That's it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you thinking now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not your real grandson, right!?
O-Ow![A]
What'd you do that for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm expressing my disgust at your
stupidity.[A]
You are indeed my grandson.[A]
I'm the one that brought you into
this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're kidding![A]
My good looks couldn't have
come from your wrinkled face![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.[A]
I would date men like you and dump
them after they spent all their[A]
money on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ouch...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your kindness comes from your father,
and your talent for anima magic comes[A]
from your mother.[A]
Your stupidity... that probably comes
from your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
My mom wasn't a Shaman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At first, I was determined to make
my son's wife a Shaman.[A]
But your mother was a fine young lady
with a distinct talent for anima magic,[A]
so I couldn't help but give in.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...I was proud of them both...
But they died so young.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You must be disappointed that all
you have left is a pathetic little[A]
grandson, eh, Grandma?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
The strange thing is, I'm not.[A]
I can't say how much I missed
yelling at you when you were gone.[A]
Maybe they really are cuter when
they're more troublesome.[A]
I certainly want you to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Grandma.[A]
[046B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There you are![A]
I never would've guessed you'd
be here in this army.[A]
I've been looking all over for you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well,
I sure wasn't looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Taking advantage of my kindness
like that...[A]
This is why I don't like kids.[A]
Now give me back my Resire book.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes.
That thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You haven't used it up
already, have you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Calm down, I've got it.
I was just borrowing it.[A]
I was planning on giving it
back to you some day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You little runt...[A]
You said you just wanted to see it
for a sec, so I lent it to you.[A]
I wasn't expecting you to take it
and run off![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, I've said this a million times.
I'm borrowing it, not stealing it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, when are you
going to return it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, let's see...[A]
I suppose I'll give it back
to you after I use it 20 times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You better keep your word![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh well, I guess I'll just
have to wait...[A]
Whoa, wait a minute![A]
It'll be gone by the time you use
it 20 times![A]
[046C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not letting you go this time!
Give me back that Resire book now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sorry, but I can't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're a mage.[A]
What's the point in you having
a Resire book?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...
That's not the point...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A powerful spell that could be
put to use in battle would be[A]
wasting away in your hands.[A]
Who would be responsible if we lost
a battle because we didn't use it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
F-Fine, I'll let you have it for
now.[A]
But you're going to give it back
to me with interest, you hear!?[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hmph, what an idiot.[A]
How can he be fooled by such a
lame excuse?[A]
I have yet to understand such
blatant stupidity.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Crap...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]You little...!
Give it back to me now![A]
[046D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll give you that gem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's none of your business.[A]
Anyway, I'm giving you that
in return for the spell book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nope.
I can't accept this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why not?[A]
The gem's enough to buy another
Resire book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't about money.
It's about my pride.[A]
...Let's see...
I want you to apologize to me.[A]
Then you can have the
spell book for free.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
I can't believe you're being so
stubborn over something so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, so are you.[A]
All you have to do is say
you're sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I won't.[A]
I've paid you back with the
gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not taking it.[A]
You're going to be in my
debt until you apologize![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hmph...
Adults.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What a stubborn little brat.[A]
[046E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123]One, two three...[A]
Yup, I've got it all.[A]
Looks like I can trust that Roy
to give me a steady paycheck.[A]
Well, I guess it's time to
show them my worth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C]Hey![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-What the?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Where'd you get all that money?
Are you a thief as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do I look like a thief to you?[A]
They paid me this money when I
joined.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!?
That's not fair!
I've been working for nothing all
this time![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess you're not good
enough to pay.[A]
You've got to show them your worth
if you want cash.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hmm...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll take those words as a challenge![A]
I'll show you my worth as a thief.[A]
I'll steal that money from right
under your nose![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, what!?
Fine, dammit![A]
Take it if you can![A]
[046F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Hugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What are you getting all
uptight about?[A]
I'm just trying to be friendly here.[A]
Do you really think I'll try to
steal in a place like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not trusting you anymore![A]
I'm gonna be on my guard whenever
you're around.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha, you've got such petty thoughts.[A]
You're getting all worked up about
a couple thousand gold?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Well, it's still money to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, I suppose I'm going to have some
trouble with you on your watch like[A]
that.[A]
I guess I'll pass it up for today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right!
Just give it up and go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.
But remember, Hugh![A]
I'll be back![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0470]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again!?[A]
It doesn't matter how many times
you come.[A]
I'm not giving you this money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you still saying that?
Geez![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then stop trying to take it![A]
I mean, don't you already have
a ton of money if you're a thief?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Why would I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, right![A]
I see you running around looting
chests all the time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I give it all to the poor.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm a master thief, I have my
dignity.[A]
I would never even keep 1G of the
money I steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
Are you going to give the money you
take from me to the poor as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hey...[A]
You can have maybe a hundred...[A]
No...[A]
I can give you around half of this
money to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
I'm a master thief,
I have my dignity.[A]
I don't take offers
from other people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I said no.
I don't want it.[A]
Besides...[A][Clear]
I've already got your money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
What... what the hell!?
When did you switch...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Cass![A]
Wait![A]
Just wait a second, please![A]
[0471]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]?
...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you use dark magic.[A]
Although it looks like you're
still a beginner.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!
...Look, old lady.[A]
I'm busy.[A]
I don't have time to spare on old
folk like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come now, there's no need to rush.[A]
Studying on your own isn't going to
get you anywhere, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
How do you know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I haven't lived this long
for nothing, boy.[A]
I think I've seen more darkness
than you have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who...[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My name is Niime.[A]
You should remember your
elders' names...[A]
[0472]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's the rude little
chap from the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You...you're 'The Hermit on the
Mountain.'[A]
The master of darkness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I see I've become famous.
What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I...
I want you to teach me your dark magic.[A][Clear]
Teach me all of it![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Boy, is that how you ask
people for favors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'll change my tone if you
don't like it.[A]
If you want me to bow my head to the
ground and apologize, I'll do it.[A]
So please, teach me your dark magic![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Hm, interesting...[A]
...All right, try reading this
for a start.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What...is this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can't you tell?[A]
It's an archaic language used
in the oldest spells.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
The ancient scrolls I know
aren't written like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand how deep
dark magic is now?[A]
I'll give you that.
Good luck reading it.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...[A]
Of course I'll read it...[A]
[0473]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Well?
How's your studying going?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
Don't even have the time to talk,
eh?[A]
You're a rude one, and you don't
Know how to respect your elders.[A][Clear]
But you seem to be serious about
learning dark magic.[A]
Boy, why do you seek the power
of darkness?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...It's not like I have some grandiose
reason.[A]
I use dark magic for myself.[A]
I want to protect those I hold dear,
and destroy all those who oppose me.[A]
That's the power I seek.[A]
The power you're trying to obtain...[A]
It's not to be taken lightly.[A]
It can tilt the planet if used
incorrectly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...so?[A]
I'll blow up a planet or two any day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
Well said, boy.[A]
Now come... come into the
depths of darkness...[A][Clear]
Of course, you're going to
have to study that book first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Nothing.[A]
[0474]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Hello...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you're the priestess of Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
My name... is Sophia...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A shy one, aren't we?[A]
Well, I suppose anyone would be shy
after spending her whole life in[A]
that place...[A]
You're just like me when I was
your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My name is Niime.[A]
I want to know more about
your village in Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About the village...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
Oh, before that...
Are you human, or Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I am human...[A]
At least...my father was human...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Forget about it.
Sorry for being so intrusive.[A]
[0475]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Arcadia...is inside the sandstorm...[A]
There aren't many Dragons...
But there are many people... who have[A]
Dragon blood... in them...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said you were a priestess,
but what exactly do you do?[A]
Do you go around doing rain dances?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...can see...
[OpenMidLeft]See?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can sometimes see...
the future...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Really?[A]
Is that because of the Dragon's
blood in you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I...don't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
You'd better not tell that to anyone
else.[A]
Your power would be too dangerous for
our enemies.[A]
Even knowing the next day's weather
could make or break a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Not all outsiders are nice people.[A]
I heard you were being held captive
by Bern, but you don't want to go[A]
through that again, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I don't...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Don't worry.[A]
Roy wouldn't think of taking advantage
of you.[A]
You're safe here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
