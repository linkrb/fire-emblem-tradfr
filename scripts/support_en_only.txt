[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still thinking,
Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I can't think of a good plan yet...
But not your plan, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I understand,
Master Roy.[A]
But if there's anything I can do,
please tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I honestly still cannot decide whether
there is such a thing as true victory.[A]
But if you believe it, then I will
support you with all my strength.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Alan.[A]
I'm sure there will come a day when
you'll understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I shall look forward
to that day![A]
[0329]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Lance, I've been thinking about what
you said, but I still think that I[A]
should stay up front.[A]
I know you were suggesting it for
my sake, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, perhaps I was too focused on my own
opinions.[A]
If you believe that your way is the best,
then it is best to pursue that path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
It's encouraging to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]However, you made one mistake
the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I did?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You said, "I'm not particularly smart,
and I don't have much charisma either."[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes, I did say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]That's the part about you that people
like.[A]
No one would give his life to someone
who has no charisma at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
If I may also add a comment, be sure
to keep that pure heart.[A]
As long as you do, our troops will
follow you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'll try.
Thank you, Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I am glad to be of
assistance.[A]
[032C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I... I don't want to go back to
the mansion after the war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
Father and Mother are anxious
for us to return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to meet Father and Mother...[A]
But if I return to the mansion,
I would just be a doll again.[A]
I would never see the outside world,
and I would only be concerned[A]
about decorating myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that is how most Etrurian
ladies are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know...[A]
But becoming the most elegant in
Etruria does not seem as appealing[A]
as it once did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's because you're growing up
and maturing, Clarine.[A]
If you stay at the mansion, you could just
live your life without doing anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it would be so horribly
boring![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed...
All right, then here's what we will do.[A]
Once this war is over, we will first
go back home and show Father and Mother[A]
that we are safe and well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then we can discuss your future
and what you want to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I already know what I want
to do![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will become a Sorcery General
like General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
As the Sorcery General, I will help your
work as the Archery General, and then we[A]
shall always be together![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...let's try and be
a little more realistic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it would be so wonderful to see
us both in the elegant uniform[A]
of the Etrurian Generals...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...[A]
Well, you're still a little
girl, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[032F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You dropped this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Oh, my ribbon...[A]
[ToggleSmile]You brought it to me.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Um...[A]
I just realized...
I don't know your name...[A]
Would you please tell me your name,
if it would not be any trouble?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Rutger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
I never even thanked you for
saving me...[A]
It is no wonder you don't
like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you for rescuing me that
time...[A]
I know it is already too late,
but if you would accept my thanks..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Not like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't try something you're
not used to.[A]
You're good at screaming,
so why don't you do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What!?
What do you mean by that!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you go...
That's more like you.[A]
Come like that and make me
laugh once in a while, Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
[0332]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...All right, you win.
I'll tell you.[A]
So just stop following me everywhere..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Finally, we understand each other.
Please begin, I am listening.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's really not that big of a deal...[A]
It's just that I once worked for your
family as a pit fighter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?
Then...[A]
Are you Dieck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I always wanted to meet you, Dieck![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You saved my brother's life![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who told you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Everyone!
My father, my mother, my brother...[A]
I grew up hearing all these good
things about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]When you left, I was still little...[A]
I remember that I always regretted
not being able to see you.[A]
But now, here we are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...
Well, now you've seen me.[A]
Satisfied?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Then you'll stop hovering
around me wherever I go, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'll follow you everywhere![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you saved my brother's life, then
that means you are an important person[A]
to me as well.[A]
And I want you to tell me what my
brother was like when he was young...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I don't think so.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh!
Wait, Dieck![A]
I won't let you go![A]
[0335]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you are not my knight...[A]
It is true that we are a princess and
a knight, am I correct?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]T-Then...[A]
I shall hereby permit you to kiss
my hand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, thank you, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lance, you do understand, do you not?[A]
This is to make clear the difference
in our status.[A]
There is no more meaning to it than
that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Of course...[A]
You could be a little more...
disappointed...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something,
my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No!
Nothing![A]
[0338]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...[A]
Nothing seems to have changed.[A]
No one seems to be noticing.
So maybe I should just give up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry!
I know you were just trying to help me...[A]
But it's not your fault![A]
You know, with me, the base isn't very
good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy![A]
That is what's wrong with you![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen to me.[A]
A fine lady must have confidence in herself.[A]
No matter how much you dress up, if you do
not have faith in yourself, it will all be[A]
in vain.[A]
You must not degrade yourself like that.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have confidence in yourself!
It is me who is teaching you.[A]
Of course you will
become a fine lady one day![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, thank you,
Lady Clarine...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...And...[A]
We are friends now,
[ToggleSmile]are we not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me 'Lady' Clarine.
Just call me Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
Okay then, thanks, Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A-Ahem!
Today we shall go over how to drink tea![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa was scared that you would grow up and
not want to play with her anymore...[A]
Fa always wants to be with you!
Fa wants to play hide-and-seek and tag[A]
[ToggleSmile]and lots of other fun games.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa...[A]
Don't worry...
I'll always...be your friend...[A]
I'll always be with you...
All right...?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were talking about your
little girl the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She came to play with Fa.[A]
When Fa was all alone in her room,
she came with Sophia to play and[A]
and tell Fa about the outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]She said you were the
'Guardian'.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
She stopped coming to play
with Fa.[A]
Fa asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.[A]
Is it Fa's fault?[A]
Was Fa a bad girl to her?[A]
Did Fa make her angry and
go to the faraway place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...that's not the case.
She was never mad at you, Fa.[A]
She just can't play with you
anymore, but...[A]
She'll always be very fond of
of you, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...of course.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Fa?[A]

Fa wants to learn more
about the big outside world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Once this war is over, we can
go to many different places.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
There are many things in this world
that have been nurtured by the Sky's[A]
blessings and the Earth's warmth.
We can go see all those things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmmm...[A]
Fa doesn't get it.
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand when you get a
little older.[A]
I know you will.[A]
[0344]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]Granny Niime![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, hello, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...[A]
I told you the story of men
and demons the other day, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah!
The pretty lights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To tell you the truth...
I was afraid of those demons.[A]
After I studied dark magic and
mankind's history...only then[A]
did I discover just how powerful
and terrifying the demons were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
After meeting you, my fear seems to
have just gone right out the window.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's nothing.[A]
Well, my long stories must be
boring you.[A]
Here.[A]
Go play with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What a fool I was...[A]
I was willing to do terrible things
to an innocent little girl for the[A]
peace and safety of our race...[A]
What was I thinking...[A]
There's no point in peace obtained
[ToggleSmile]through such hideous measures.[A]
[0347]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Elphin?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, what is it, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa always wanted
to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?
I hope I can give you an answer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ummmm...
[ToggleSmile]Are you a girl or a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Which do you think?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa thought you were a girl
at first cause you're so pretty[A]
and you smell real nice![A]
But then Roy said the other day
that you were a man...[A]
So that makes you a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am a boy.
...Were you disappointed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope!
...Sooo, you're a boy...[A]
Heehee...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Fa's gonna get as pretty
as you when she grows up.[A]
So wait till then, kay?
Promise![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Fa! Wait![A][......]
[ToggleSmile]...I seriously doubt that I will still
be alive by the time she grows up...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose I should let it go for now.[A]
[034A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our Father the Sky has not only
brought us misfortune.[A]
Some good things happened
after we lost.[A]
Especially for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The land isn't as it used to be.[A]
We of Sacae must think with broader
perspectives outside of the clans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Chief...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have learned much
during your travels.[A]
I'm already too old to change my way
of thinking.[A]
But you are still young.[A]
It is your responsibility to lead
Sacae to a brighter future.[A]
This is an order from your Chief, Shin.[A]
It is up to you youths to decide Sacae's
fate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[034D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is the matter, Lady Sue?
You don't look well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I heard you were ambushed...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not hurt, my Lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Shin, I want you to retreat to the
back lines.[A]
I will take over for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying, Lady Sue?
It should be the other way around![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've made up my mind.
You're going to step back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retreat to the back lines, Shin!
This is an order.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Everyone...
They were all killed by Bern...[A]
I couldn't even track down the traitor
in our ranks, and...they were all killed,[A]
right in front of my eyes...[A]
I was helpless, Shin.[A]
I don't want that feeling again.
I don't want to lose you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Sue...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must not die before I do.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was ordered to protect you, Lady Sue.
There is no way I would leave you and die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you promise?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.[A]
[0350]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...strange.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I am?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacaean women rarely pick up weapons.
Even if they do, they would choose a bow.[A]
You would rarely see a girl pick up a sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And...[A]
Sacaean people worship the
Sky and Earth.[A]
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...[A]
I have never seen a Sacaean like
you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.[A]
People can also live freely like you...
You've taught me a lesson.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think you're exaggerating...[A]
But it feels nice to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have beautiful eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of[A]
mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
Thank you![A]
[0353]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
...But why am I worrying so much
over him?[A]
...I can't figure that out, either.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I have to figure out a way to talk
to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, um...er...

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, hello...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, wh...what...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What...what...kind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What food of kind you do like?
...... ...Shoot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind of food do I like, right?
I like fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...
...Did you hear me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]

Behind you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you all right?[A]
I guess even you have some trouble
when you're surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll be going now.[A]
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't make that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did the other day![A]
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally[A]
make a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.[A]
...There's no way I would shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[0359]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]You look a lot better now,
Sue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I still can't forget that I couldn't rescue
our fellow clansmen, but I've decided not to[A]
dwell on the past.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll look forward towards the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it seems that you've learned
something from our ride the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was able to listen to a lot of
nature's voices for a change.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![A]
[ToggleSmile]I couldn't stand seeing you look
so distressed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had such a look on my face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others wouldn't know,
but I would.[A]
I'm your grandfather.
I've known you ever since you were born.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was only doing my duty...
as your grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
[035C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wolt?[A]
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Geez, it sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...[A]
I mean, remember how you said it was easier
to keep up with your target on horseback?[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You tried it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't know unless I actually try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How did you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you can't beat a horse's speed.[A]
Still, I think it's more stable on foot, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought it was dangerous to try something
you're not used to in battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
Well, I only tried it for a little bit.
So it's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to take advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Although, I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shoot very well?[A]
I probably wouldn't even be able to stay on!
Yeah...[A]
I think I should stay on the ground.
It seems to be more fit for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hehehe.
Perhaps you're right.[A]
[035F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The seven affinities...[A]
Their effects will only appear
through bonds with other people.[A]
When your heart is linked with
someone else's...[A]
That is when the elements reveal
their true power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Saint Elimine also said to cherish
your relationships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I wonder if we have been able to
link our hearts with each other.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am sure we have.[A]
We have yet to find out
what effects it has...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Gonzales.[A]
It seems that whenever you are with
me, you get injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here,
I'll give you this as an apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.[A]
It would suit a fine warrior like
you nicely.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this as well.[A]
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I happy.[A]
I drink.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait,
don't...drink so much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
Uhhhhhhhh?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales!
Can you get up?[A]
This wine is very strong.[A]
You shouldn't drink so much of
it at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhhhhh...[A]
[0365]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
What will you do after this war is over?
Do you have a place to go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I thought.[A]
Then would you join the
Kutolah clan?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Our clan has lost,
but we haven't been destroyed.[A]
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once again.[A]
It would be helpful if you were
there with us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't take offers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not an offer.[A]
I am asking you because I have
faith in your strength as a warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hm...
Difficult person, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I shall say no more.[A]
But always remember that if you
ever change your mind, we will[A]
welcome you with open arms.[A]
Keep that in mind...
wherever you go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Yeah.[A]
[0368]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barth...[A]
What do you think will happen
to Ostia now, without my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Unless someone rebuilds Ostia after this
war is done, it will fall further and[A]
further into chaos.[A]
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
I don't think I'm qualified.[A]
I'm just going to be a
nuisance to you all...[A]
You...think so too,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know not how a person in power
should be, but...[A][Clear]
When you said that you wanted to trust
your servants, I certainly did not[A]
feel that you were mistaken in
thinking so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I have one thing to say to you,
my lady.[A]
No matter what kind of path that
you would follow from now on,[A]
we knights will swear our
loyalty to always support you.[A]
[036B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
Is someone doing practice swings...?[A]
[ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Phew...[A]
I wonder if I've gotten any closer
to Sir Barth now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Woah!?[A]
Oh, Sir Barth!
You scared me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good,
very good.[A]
You see, your body has
gotten used to training itself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel like I just have to keep
moving my body.[A]
And besides, I would hate to lose someone
because I wasn't strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[A]
If you keep a habit of training yourself,
you will never get tired in battle.[A]
It doesn't matter whether you are an
Armor Knight or Mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
But I thought you wanted to
make me an Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just said that to make you train
as a habit.[A]
I know your build wouldn't be able
to handle heavy armor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It encouraged you more,
didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It did?
I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What did you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing...[A]
[036E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ask me what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why did you want to become an
Armor Knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because I wanted to protect those
I love with this armor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What about you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I became an Armor Knight because
they are strongest fighters.[A]
I believe that in a 1 on 1 battle, no
other unit can match the Armor Knight.[A]
...Which is probably why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina against a large horde...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That happened because I wasn't
strong enough.[A]
If I had enough power to stop the
rebellion all on my own,[A]
I would not have allowed the situation
to get out of hand.[A]
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Then you are to become a spear
stronger than any other.[A]
And I shall become a shield tougher
than any other.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A spear and a shield...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let us together make the way for the
lives that we shall lead in the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds good, friend![A]
[0371]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth,
how can I improve my skills further?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're already a full-fledged
Ostian knight, Wendy.[A]
I don't have anything to
criticize you for.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you![A]
But...
Sir Barth...[A]
Can you...
say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
I'm sure there is something
I need to work on, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
From now on,
you must judge your own self.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I want you to teach me more...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't...
Don't leave me, Sir Barth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
What are you talking about?[A]
We are now comrades
fighting together.[A]
I wouldn't just leave you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
...We have wasted enough time
talking like this.[A]
Let's get moving, Wendy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![A]
[0374]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
...How did it go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
It took some time, but
I'm much more confident.[A]
The princess is innocent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere really
trusts General Roy.[A]
So does everyone else here.
Well, what do you know...[A]
This ragtag group's bond is
pretty strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I'm relieved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.
So that's taken care of.[A]
When we get someone new, I'll
be sure to keep an eye on him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry to have to give all
this dirty work to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.[A]
[0377]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]You look much better today,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I feel much better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is good to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like Roy was avoiding me or
anything...[A]
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I was getting left behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was just jumping to conclusions
and fretting over nothing...[A]
Once I realized that, it suddenly
seemed so silly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm still a kid, aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, will you always stay
by my side from now on?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I am a knight,
and my loyalty is with you.[A]
I shall always be there for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors...[A]
[037A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa, W-Wendy!
We certainly meet a lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, brother.
Did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.
Just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am really grateful for your
consideration all the time.[A]
But I am a knight of Ostia.[A]
I'm training myself so I can
become like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I want to become strong, I can't
be depending on you all the time.[A]
I'm going to be fine, really, so
please don't worry...[A]
I must be off.[A]
...I'm really grateful for you,
brother.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
...I see...[A]
She's grown so much.[A]
I suppose I was the one...
being childish...[A][Clear]
Wendy, I wish you luck.[A]
[037D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eh...?
Oh, Bors.[A]
Come on,
have a drink with me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop blaming yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We lost Lord Hector.
The responsibility lies in all of us.[A]
But... Still...
We must not look back to the past.[A]
We must move forward.[A]
We have to make the dream that Lord
Hector couldn't fulfill come true.[A]
And we need you for that, Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You... why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you...defend a drunken,
useless wretch like me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is because you are
a knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A knight?
Who...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Although you have not
been officially knighted...[A]
You fought with your life to
defend Lord Hector.[A]
That is more than enough
to make you a loyal knight.[A]
At least, I would think so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Bo..rs... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor, let us walk the path...
[CloseSpeechFast]and fulfill the dream of our master.[A]
[0380]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors, you said the other day that
there must always be a cause in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And for that cause, you must be willing
to go through any and all hardships.[A]
Do you have such a cause?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
Unfortunately, I don't.[A]
I became a mercenary to feed
my family.[A]
So I don't really have a cause...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've got one right there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Feeding your family is a great cause.[A]
And for that cause, you train yourself
and become stronger, stronger than[A]
anyone else.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]A cause is not just limited to
large scale things like defending[A]
your country or saving the world.[A]
All right?[A]
[0383]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Odd?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are in a much higher position
than we are...[A]
But you still come right down to talk
to us with a smile on you face.[A]
It seems...odd.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?
I just want to be friends with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]F-Friends?[A]
I don't think that would be
possible, my lady..[A]
You are my master![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't make a difference.[A]
You're the only girl around my age
that grew up in the same area.[A]
Let's not worry about who's the
master or the servant...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina![A]
You are carrying Ostia's future
on your shoulders.[A]
You are different from us.[A]
You do understand, do you not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...So we can't be friends?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
But I am very grateful for
your consideration.[A]
Perhaps we cannot be friends,[A]
but would you allow me to go over
and chat with you once in awhile?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
...Thank you, Wendy.[A]
[0386]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]How are you doing, Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm doing well, of course.[A]
I can't be complaining if I want
to be a strong Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, me too.
If I want to be a powerful mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oujay, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been able to keep trying
because I'm competing with you.[A]
If I didn't have you with me, I
probably would have given up, sayingア[A]
'It wouldn't have been possible
for a girl anyway.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I feel the same way.[A]
I've been able to come this far
thanks to you.[A]
We're even.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
But I still won't allow myself
to lose to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll throw those words right
back at you, Wendy![A]
[0389]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wendy.
Beautiful as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can't flatter me like that.
I understand about your leg.[A]
But!
I still have a lot to tell you![A]
First,
about your drinking habits...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh damn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, you're not getting away.[A]
You shall behave like a proper
Ostian knight from now on![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh...[A]
[038C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.[A]
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.[A]
You don't mind that just for
now, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]
Then I shall pledge my loyalty to you as
another human being, not as a general.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is ever so
hard to bend your ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My unbending will is my strength.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This war will end soon.[A]
General Roy is still young,
but he understands the people.[A]
He will lead not only Etruria, but the
whole continent to a Gilded Age of peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I should do something as well,
don't you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall accompany you
wherever you go.[A]
[038F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
You have done me a great favor.[A]
It would be dishonoring my
family's name if I didn't return it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man,
you knights are so hard-headed.[A]
I swear, if you found gold on the
street, you wouldn't dare pocket it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh....
Fine, let me think...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...All right, here's what I want.[A]
I want you and your king to
make your country a good one.[A]
Make it a nation that won't go
around causing stupid wars.[A]
And make it a nation where people can
travel and do business safely.[A]
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you don't
do that for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Geese...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You deserve much better
than being a pirate.[A]
I will promise to fulfill
your requests.[A]
I shall swear my life to them![A]
[0392]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it,
Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I said this before,
but as an Etrurian General,[A]
I cannot promise you what you ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, I will do my best to
fulfill your request.[A]
I shall spread the word that among the
heroes who rescued the king were warriors[A]
from Nabata.[A]
I shall persuade the nobles never
to disturb your peace in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I shall remember those words.[A]
I suppose that is all I can ask of
you now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[A]
[0395]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival.[A]
It might be a bit early to say
this, but..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am thinking of retiring as the
Great General after this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
Then the highest position in the
Etrurian military would be empty![A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you...
to take my place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am still young, Lord Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are young?
Then what about our commander, Roy?[A]
He is much younger than you,
and he is leading all of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The youths will not grow if old
veterans keep hogging their positions.[A]
Percival, you are intelligent, strong
and a fine leader.[A]
Besides, once the prince returns, the
king will step down from the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Douglas![A]
Those in service must not talk about
the inheritance of the throne...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is all right.[A]
I have been serving the king
for decades now.[A]
I know him better than anybody.[A]
I am sure once he learns of the prince's
survival, he will give the throne to him[A]
without hesitation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.[A]
Etruria will be reborn again with
the help from you young ones.[A]
I will be counting on you, Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I shall swear my life to it.[A]
[0398]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must thank you.[A]
You've helped out an old,
worthless soldier like me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
What are you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whenever I fight,
I can feel my age.[A]
Aged soldiers are of no use.
My time has ended.[A]
It is now up to you to lead
Etruria to a bright future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I've never heard you say something
so stupid, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]A bright future for Etruria?
You can talk about that after we win.[A]
Even if we do win this war, we have
much to worry about.[A]
We must rebuild our land and regain
other nations' trust.[A]
Etruria's future comes...
after all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you're going to put all that responsibility
on us, while you take it easy?[A]
I don't think so, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You really have grown
more confident.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is thanks to you.[A]
Now, if you feel defeated,
why don't you be of some use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...very well.[A]
I suppose I can't be outdone by
you amateurs yet.[A]
Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, Lord Douglas.[A]
[039B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Father!
Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Lalum?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've finally found a way to
really cheer you up![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum...
It's the feeling that counts.[A]
Your consideration is enough
encouragement.[A]
You don't have to stress yourself
out so much, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not stressing myself![A]
If you look sad,
then I feel down, too.[A]
But if you're laughing,
then I feel happy as well![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum...
You're a really good girl.[A]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, thank you.[A]
Thank you for picking me up off the street
and treating me like your own daughter.[A]
I...[A]
I actually like myself now,
after you adopted me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalum...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
Father, you're looking all
teary again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoops...
I must watch myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, now let me cheer you up
with my latest dance![A]
[039E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wolt.[A]
You don't look so troubled for
a change.[A]
Well, do you still want me to
teach you how to wield a sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, after hearing your words, I cast
away my hesitation.[A]
I will perfect my skills with my bow,
and I will train myself so that Roy[A]
can count on me without doubt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]
With that attitude, it looks like
I can let you take over for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
B-But if you leave now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Calm down, I didn't say right at
this minute.[A]
Still, it won't be that far away.[A]
Once I am gone, you must take care
of Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, that's not it...[A]
It's just that...
can I really do it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There now, see?
You have to fix your lack of confidence.[A]
You will worry Master Roy with an
attitude like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can do it.
Have confidence in yourself![A]
[03A1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]98...[A]
99...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Alan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you training as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
After watching, I couldn't just
sit around waiting.[A]
I have to become strong
to protect Master Roy as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
That's the spirit![A]
Become strong,
and surprise Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Sir Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt.
...Are you all right?[A]
Your eyes seem to be
rather red...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes!
I'm fine.[A]
I was just reading the book on
war tactics that you lent me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, good job.
Were you reading it all night?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right,
you might be interested in this next.[A]
It's by the same author, and he describes
his ideas in detail over the course of[A]
24 volumes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you read this, then you should be
able to master the basics fairly easily.[A]
After that, we can go into more advanced
details...Wolt?[A]
Are you listening?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Y...Yes!
Of course![A]
I'll do my best...[A]
[03A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
I haven't heard a valid excuse
about the other day yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I am sorry...[A]
I am sorry that I...could not
understand your feelings...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see what you were trying
to say the other day.[A]
You wanted to sayア[A]
'If you're asking every girl out...
why don't you do the same to me?'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wha...!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, er, um...
Th-That was just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I am a servant of God...[A]
I must be equally caring to all women.
Please forgive me, Dorothy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...Um,
er... I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How did that sound, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I pondered a lot, but that was the
best excuse I could come up with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]V-Violence is not appropriate,
Dorothy.[ToggleMouthMove]
Our loving God surely would not
approve of someone pointing their[A]
bow at an ally...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't care![A]
You better get out of my sight
before I shoot you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...[A]
What are you so upset about?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's your fault![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[03AA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]...Yes![A]
Yes, that was great![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Percival![A]
I'm trying to relax when I shoot,
as you said.[A]
I think...
I think I'm getting better at it![.....][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You originally seemed to have talent
with the bow.[A]
It was just a matter of getting your
confidence together, and now that you[A]
have, you'll be improving more and more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can relax if I think that the others
are defending the front lines...[A]
It seems that you can sometimes
feel safe even on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but that is the same for
us up front as well.[A]
We would not be able to charge in like we
do, if we didn't have adequate support[A]
from the back lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Am I being of use to
you too, General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you're helping me out a
great deal.[A]
I shall be looking forward to
your support in future battles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About that story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...[A]
[ToggleSmile]So I still don't get its point...[A]
I sort of have an idea of what it
might be about, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then you have an answer, Dorothy.[A]
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.[A]
Each person interprets the story
and comes up with his own answers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, good.[A]
Bishop Yodel,
I think I feel better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, what did Saint Elimine do
after that?[A]
Does the story continue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The journey of Saint Elimine is
a long one.[A]
The next day when Saint Elimine
was continuing on her travels...[A]
[03B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight]General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.
I just saw you, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You know, I was thinking...[A]
Before the coup d'etat, we never
were working together in the same[A]
mission.[A]
But now, here we are, fighting
alongside each other, after we have[A]
both left the Etrurian military and
are under General Roy's command.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, yes...
Fate can work in strange ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
Oh, on a different topic...[A]
Have your favorite foods
changed over the recent years?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
...No.
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's just that the cook was a[A]
little worried.[A]
He says that since you are
expressionless no matter what[A]
you eat, he never knows what
to give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressionless?
...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, very much so,
General Percival.[A]
Even when you have wine, your
expression stays the same no[A]
matter what you drink.[A]
If you stop making expressions,
you'll forget how to make them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressions are not things
that can be forgotten.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't be so sure about
that with you, General Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well, well.
Getting fresh, are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Haha...I guess it looks
like I need not worry.[A]
[03B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Klein, I told you not to
come talk to me this often.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wanted to tell you a story.[A]
I want you to listen because we're
in such turbulent times.[A]
...It was 15 years ago, at Aquleia's
best arena.[A]
A noble's child was attacked by one
of the lions that were used in the[A]
opening show.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]A young pitfighter was the one who
saved the child.[A]
Ordinarily, he was a skilled swordfighter
who could defeat men twice his size[A]
with ease.[A]
But this time he was up against a
lion, so he didn't come out unscathed.[A]
He was wounded all over his body, and
his face suffered four deep scars.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The noble hired the swordsman who
saved his child into his service.[A]
For several years, the young man
served as the family's pitfighter[A]
and spread his name at the arena.[A]
But one day, he suddenly bought
his freedom and left.
The child, who looked up to the
pitfighter as if he were his[A]
real brother thought that he
 was betrayed, and was saddened.[A]
...But now I understand.[A]
You were thinking the best for
our family..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...You were much too kind to
me, a simple servant.[A]
Lord Pent and his wife raised me
as if I were their real child,[A]
regardless of the complaints and
finger-pointing going on around them.[A]
...That's why I left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand how you feel.
But I don't agree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were always thinking
the best for us...[A]
But did you ever consider the fact
that we were concerned for you also?[A]
I don't want us to be in a relation
in which we ignore each other...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Looks like I was being selfish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
Then you'll be with us like a
family again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you win Little Master Klein.[A]
I'll be sure to show my face to[A]
Lord Pent whenever I get the chance.[A]
[03B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We can have some
privacy here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pr-...Master Elphin,
you wanted to speak with me?[A]
Is it about Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
It is about the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
Are you talking about the
'Master' thing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not think it is strange
for an Etrurian noble to call a[A]
simple bard a 'Master'?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...!
Yes, you're right![A]
Forgive me.[A]
I shall call you Sir
Elphin instead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
Just 'Elphin' will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That will not do![A]
Even if you are in disguise,
I cannot address my prince[A]
simply by name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]???[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
Do you remember how you used to often
come to the palace with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I've been going to the palace as
long as I remember.[A]
Since I had no siblings, I couldn't
help but think of how cute you were[A]
as a toddler.
And I was still young and foolish,[A]
so I told your fatherア 'Your son
hall now be my younger brother![A]
'He must live in the palace from
now on.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, the prince,
said that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I was a fool.[A]
Of course, your father didn't know
what to say.[A]
And then you spoke up.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And you said the same words.
'That will not do.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]'I'm going to be your knight,
so that will not do.'[A]
Those were your exact words.
You also saidア[A]
'Chose someone else for your
brother!'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I-I was so rude...
I, uh...Forgive me, your Highness..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do not worry about it.
I'm glad you haven't changed.[A]
...When I came back from the[Clear]
[ToggleSmile]brink of death, the world[A]
looked so different.[A]
I'm glad some things are still
the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[03B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidLeft]Tate, when this war ends, I
could help you find an army[A]
that pays well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, even though you said that
you're fighting with us on your[A]
own will, my being here is still
one of the reasons you stayed.[A]
I just thought that I should
compensate by helping out with[A]
your future plans...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I can do that on my own.[A]
I appreciate your consideration,
but please do not worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Or is my being here a
hindrance to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No!
Not at all![A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why are you telling
me things like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What's the matter, Tate?
How come you're so upset..?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ever since this other day,
all you've been talking about is[A]
getting me out of this army...
Away from you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Well, I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I chose to stay by your side
because I love you![A]
But you...
You're so inconsiderate![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, well...
I'm sorry.[A]
It's just that...I didn't..
know you felt that way about me..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]So...[A]
You know, Tate, you're to
blame as well![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You keep calling me
'General Klein, General Kleinア'[A]
like you want to keep your
distance with me![A]
That's why you make me think
that you're simply tagging[A]
along out of responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]B-But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No 'General' from now on.
Just call me Klein, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.
Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
[ToggleSmile]Oh...Yes...Klein.[A]
[03BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft]Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean,
Bishop Yodel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I know Master Roy
well enough to trust him.[A]
The Fire Emblem will be safe
in his hands.[A]
What we were fearing surely
not happen now.[A]
Do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps you are right.[A]
..However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I understand what
you are saying, Bishop Yodel.[A]
Master Roy is certainly a
noble person.[A]
Still...[A]
I think this world is a bit too
ugly yet for Master Roy to handle.[A]
I think that I know that more than
the other priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I am still a youngster.
You may forget what I said.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
All right then.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
I recently found this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
This is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]'All wounds treated freely.
Special discounts for new members now.[A]
Sign up today!'[A]
This...treating God like some sort of
vulnerary.[A]
I certainly do not want to think
that someone serving God would[A]
write something like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Saul, would you like to listen
to my lecturing for a little while?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Bishop Yodel, I am certainly
not worthy of having the privilege[A]
of listening to your...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Would you like to listen?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, yes I would,
Bishop Yodel...[A]
[03BF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ah!
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Very well, I shall invite you
to my manor when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall be looking forward to that![A]
It is not ever day that one invited
to a high-class Etrurian noble[A]
mansion.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be a[A]
little...difficult.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Difficult?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.[A]
However, once when I was still
a child, I invited a male friend of[A]
mine to our house.[A]
When he saw that, he just drew his
sword on my friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
Is that really a matter of
being difficult?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father lost his temper,
and so we tried to calm him down.[A]
However, it was not easy.[A]
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,[A]
and what was supposed to be a
dinner party became more like[A]
an arena.[A]
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.[A]
That will always be a day to
remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
But my father is still on the
good end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You see, my grandfather can be even
more difficult than my father...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, I just remembered![A]
I had some work left at the church
that I must attend to.[A]
I'm terribly sorry, but since it seems
that arranging a dinner meeting would[A]
be difficult, I shall be off now...[A]
Good day, General Cecilia![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?
Well I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[03C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?[A]
Ah, so you finally decided give
in to the urge, and see me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is about what you said the
other day...[A]
You said that God does not help
us because He believes in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]This is what Saint Elimine said.[A]
God who created this world is all-
powerful.[A]
He can change people and the world.[A]
He can alter us humans so that we
so that we would not be fighting[A]
like this.[A]
However, is that really the right
way?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Humans that act according to God's
[Clear]will alone would be mindless puppets.[A]
God believes that we humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.[A]
God knows that we can overcome our
hardships to achieve harmony.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
I don't believe in God, but I respect
people who think as you do, Father Saul.[A]
I must be off now...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, it is my pleasure to be
able to help you.[A]
Now, we can go on to discuss our
dinner meeting.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Saul...
Why did you not come that night?[A]
Everyone was looking forward very
much to your preaching..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, um...
My throat wasn't doing well that day.[A]
We can do that some other time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Father Saul, you really are a
noble person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Excuse me?
Noble?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Usually you appear to be a impious,
improper womanizer.[A]
Hardly someone I would call a priest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there
was a complicated reason to that.[A]
You were putting on a show to show
how free the Elimine Church is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[A]
I, uh...see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting like that would naturally
cause misunderstandings..[A]
Everyone thinks you're just a lazy
man chasing after women...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you purposely walk that path for
the benefit of the Church.[A]
I surely could not do the same.
I sincerely respect you, Father Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
Well anyways, remember to relax
once in awhile, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father Saul.[A]
[03C8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Ellen, you look a lot
better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I feel like I relieved myself
of a huge load after you were kind[A]
enough to listen to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I'm no good, am I...[A]
I am the cleric, I'm the one who
is supposed to listen to you and[A]
relieve your stress..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen, didn't I tell you before
that you mustn't mull over[A]
things like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm actually grateful that you
didn't tell me when you went[A]
off with the Princess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thankful...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
You protected Princess Guinevere
while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Miledy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's continue to work together to
help Princess Guinevere in the future.[A]
So no more feeling down over trivial
matters, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[03CB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Ellen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir...Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]These flowers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're the same as the ones you
were growing back in Bern, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ellen?
What's wrong?[A]
Wait, are these the wrong flowers?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you always...
so good to me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?
Ah, er, well...[A]
Well, we come from the same town,
and uh...I don't know, it's just[A]
that I can't...leave you alone,[A]
[ToggleSmile]you know?[A]
I want to stay by your side and[.....]
protect you...[A]
Is that not good?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm very glad...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I must stay at
Princess Guinevere's side...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
I'm also a knight of Bern, so
I'll protect the princess with[A]
[ToggleSmile]with all my strength.[A]
So let's defend the Princess,
and someday we can return to[A]
Bern together![OpenMidLeft]Yes[A]
Thank you Zeiss...
Thank you...[A]
[03CE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x121][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Miss Ellen![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lou?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I thought I saw an enemy near
you, so...[A]
Phew...[A][......]
[ToggleSmile]But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were looking out for me?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
I said I would protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have such a kind heart...[A]
I am sure God would look favorably
on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... When you smile like that,
you look like a saint![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A saint?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I was always worried because you
always seem to look a little sad.[A]
Well, I suppose it can't be helped
in a time like this...[A]
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lou, I feel better when I see you
smile as well.[A]
[03D1]
tlr me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[03D4]
pe.[A]
But that was a decoy...[A]
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
You did your best.[A]
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...I'll try.[A]
[03D7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel, I must thank you
For helping me so I wouldn't[A]
feel so alienated in the army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
It is my pleasure.[A]
Trifinne...your master is a very
kind-hearted person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a lot of
stress, too.[A]
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...[A]
I've dragged her along with my
selfish motives...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that Bern's training
implements absolute loyalty in its[A]
troops.[A]
Both in their knights, and their
mounts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is the case, then why is
Trifinne following your orders[A]
and fighting against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am sure that there were other
Dragon Knights and even Bern's[A]
in the enemy ranks.[A]
If this wyvern is simply a
creature that would follow the[A]
army's commands, she would not
be here with you now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand?[A]
This wyvern thought on her own
and made up her own mind.[A]
She chose to be with you.[A]
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...She made up her own mind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are a blessed person,
Miss Miledy.[A]
You always have close friends
at your side.[A]
You don't need me to do
anything special.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chad![A]
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A]
No, I was just thinking that it's
been a long time since we joined[A]
this army.[A]
I wonder how the little ones are
doing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I wonder.
[ToggleSmile]I hope they're being good
listening to the Elimine[A]
priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder if they're waiting for
us to return...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sure they are.
We're family, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know...
I'm glad that you came with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Then does that mean you think
I'm strong enough?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I already knew that you were
strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How can I say this...[A]
You have a twin brother,
Ray, right?[A]
So I kinda felt that even
if we three were together,[A]
I would be sort of left out.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean![A]
I always thought of you as
family, just as much as Ray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know!
Now I know better.[A]
I was just creating a wall around
myself and was trapped inside.[A]
But now I think of you as my
real family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Okay, I'll forgive you.[A]
You're my older brother,
even if you're a...[A]
little...childish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!
Lugh, you![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha...[A]
[03DD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't ignore me.
I have to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When this war is over,
what are you going to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll go pick up the little
ones first.[A]
Then I'll try and get some money
to rebuild the orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'll go with you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can help out until the
little kids settle down.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I thought so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're actually a good guy
deep down inside.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh always used to say that you
were kind.[A]
I used to think that he was trying
to defend you as his brother, but[A]
I guess not.[A]
He's your brother all right, and he
knows how you really are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're just as naive
as Lugh![A]
Say what you want!
I'm going![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha, there's no need to
get embarrassed...[A]
Hey! Wait!
Don't walk off for real![A]
[03E0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Servant How have you been doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been watching you.
You seem to have been improving.[A]
Well of course, you're not as
good as I am, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, whatever.[A]
I never became your servant,
all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
If not my servant, how about
[ToggleSmile]my partner?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Partner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.
We can be partners.[A]
The famous pair of thieves,
out to save the poor![A][Clear]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pair...[A]
...That in itself doesn't sound
too appealing.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Wait a minute![A]
It's the master thief giving you
this offer![A]
I said wait![A]
[03E3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Hey!
Chad![A]
Have you been doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I suppose.
But not as well as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Man, are you always like that?[A]
Can't you say something like,[A]
[ToggleSmile]'Hey, Hugh!
What's up?'[A]
or something with a bright
smile on your face?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sick?
Aw, come on![A]
You know, you got me all worked
up after you told me that story.[A]
I really want to help out![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Mister, are you really a mage?[A]
You sure you're not some kind of
jester or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]M-Mister!?[A]
Wait a minute, you're calling this
superbly handsome young man, a mister!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're a mister from my view.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh![A]
You stabbed me in my sensitive
spot just now![A]
...Not Mister, Mister won't do![A]
You can call me anything, but
not Mister![A]
I have a really sensitive soul,
soul, you know![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... Hahahahahahahahaha![A]
Haha...hee...my...my stomach...!
Hahaha...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh man, that was funny.
You're pretty weird, aren't you?[A]
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
That's okay, right?[A]
Since you say you're not a Mister.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you can laugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, you've always got that
glare in your eye.[A]
Your eyebrows are always bunched
up like this, you know?[A]
And you've got a foul mouth,
you've got an attitude, and you[A]
don't even smile.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying all of
a sudden?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen so many kids who've lost
the ability to smile in this war.[A]
Grown-ups have a lot of issues, but
come on, kids have to be laughing.[A]
Although it seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose[A]
there's still hope for this world.[A]
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a[A]
while, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.[A]
Don't mess up, you got that?[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...[A]
[03E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please tell me,
Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What is true strength...?
What is the way...?[A]
What...[A]
What must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fir.[A]
You were always looking at your
Mother's back and following after her.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]And you've come to me for advice
because you lost sight of your mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But, Fir.[A]
You are not your mother,
nor are you me.[A]
The path which you seek
does not lie behind us.[A]
It lies in front of you.[A]
It is you who must cut open
that path for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In front...of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That isn't something that can
be taught.
It is something which you must
discover on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
Thank you, Uncle![A]
[03E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...After she fell sick, my wife
started telling me about her family[A]
for the first time.[A]
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you when she left this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Around that time was when we
first met each other as well...[A]
You resembled my wife when we
first met.[A]
You were inhumanly strong...
yet dangerous, and forbidding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
That time, I left you two without
saying a word.[A]
You must have thought what a
[ToggleSmile]terrible brother I was.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.NL
[03EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]...Do you need something,
Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sense no hate in your sword...[A]
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.[A]
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't cut through air...[A]
Your sword would beat them all.
I want to become stronger.[A]
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place, then would I be[A]
able to blend with the air
as you do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was born in Sacae as well.[A]
I grew up under the protection of
of our Father the Sky, and our[A]
Mother the Earth.[A]
They are all that are in my
sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not a pure Sacaean...[A]
I wouldn't be able to sense
them like you can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Was that true when you
were young?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were able to hear the sky
and earth once.[A]
Although it seems that your
hate is covering your ears.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course you will.[A]
The breeze that runs through
the plains...[A]
It never forgets those that
it loves.[A]
[03EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why...[A]
Why did you tell me that
story?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...I thought that you would[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]be able to guide me...
Perhaps you would be able to help[A]
me get rid of my hesitation...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Unfortunately, I don't have any
words of guidance for you.[A]
But...
I can say this.[A]
It is you who must carve[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]your own path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Zeiss...[A]
I think you already
have an answer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.
Perhaps...[A]
I just wanted someone to tell
me that the path I chose wasn't[A]
a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I understand now.[A]
I chose to turn against my country...
And I won't regret that decision.[A]
[03F2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Master Karel...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I should tell you the
truth.[A]
Keeping silent to cover up one's
shame would be stepping off the[A]
path of the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shame?
You saved my village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
I never thought about saving the
Village.[A]
I just wanted to kill.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was like a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.[A]
I was aimlessly wandering around
looking for people to satisfy my[A]
lust for blood.[A]
As long as I could cut, as long
as I could kill, it didn't[A]
matter who it was.[A]
...Even if it were an infant in a
village I happened to stop by at.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...[A]
But it is a false name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]But...[A]
I can't imagine that what you
[ToggleSmile]say is true when I look at[A]
you now.[A]
You, standing before me now,
is the Sword Saint that I had[A]
always pictured in my mind.[A]
What...
What happened...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Some things you will realize only
after you have lost something else.[A]
However, by the time that my
foolishness had left me...[A]
It was already too late.[A]
[03F5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiiiir![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fi-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113]I can hear you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Fir.
You were all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father!
Enough is enough![A]
I'll be quite fine on my own!
I don't need your overprotection![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Forgive me.
I was wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Forgive me, my daughter...[A]
I just wanted to make up for
our lost time together.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lost...time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
When you were still a little girl,
both your mother and I were always[A]
training.[A]
I regret now that we didn't pay
enough attention to you.[A]
You never knew your parents'
warmth and protection...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you grew up to be a strong,
confident young woman.[A]
However, that isn't thanks to me.[A]
So I just wanted to be able to
help you anyway I could...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father...
You were always kind and loving.[A]
Whenever I was about to fall
apart, you held me in your[A]
strong arms and comforted me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Father...
I was happy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fir...
Oh, my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]F-Father![A]
Please don't cry in a place
like this![A]
[03F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait, Fir!
Don't go.[A]
I need to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I...[A]
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.[A]
But...[A]
I find my mind wandering, and
I'm always thinking about you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir...[A]
[OpenMidRight]G-Goodbye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113]Wha-...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you remember
the first time we met?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.[A]
But I couldn't muster up the guts
to do so.[A]
Even after we said goodbye to each
other, I've been regretting that I[A]
didn't tell you how I felt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I honestly thought it was a miracle
when we met on that island.[A]
And...[A]
Although I've been keeping it in
until now, I won't hesitate anymore.[A]
I have to tell you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir,
I...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]I love you.[A]
[03FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
Wait, please don't glare at
me like that...[A]
I'm not here to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]But your skills are indeed impressive.
I still see you as a goal to reach.[A]
I wish I could be as strong as you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Just be yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My blade is covered with blood.[A]
There is no need to see your goal
in that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Someone once told me...[A]
'All paths of the sword lead to
one place.'[A]
I still have yet to find out if
that is true or not, but I can[A]
say that your sword is definitely
on some kind of path.[A]
But I still have much to learn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Think what you will.[A]
[03FE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm having trouble sleeping.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the leader of the Bulgar
attack you saw the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.
Well...maybe.[A]
Even after I see him dead, my
nightmares still persist.[A]
At that attack...
They left only me alive...[A]
The reason was because I...
didn't look like a Sacae native.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tough to kill someone with the
same colored skin.[A]
But you do have Sacaen blood in[A]
you, don't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
My father's mother and my mother's
father were Sacaean.[A]
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so there
are a lot of mixed people there.[A]
But usually the Sacaean side is
stronger in mixed children's[A]
in mixed children's appearances.[A]
But I...[A]
Only in me did the Bern side come
come out more, so I was kept alive...[A]
The people of Bulgar...they were
kind to me, even though I looked[A]
different...[A]
But they...they were killed,
so brutally![A]
I must destroy Bern...![A]
That one man isn't enough to
satisfy my revenge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought you had some kind of,
burden, but now I see it clearly...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I guess I'll go along
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have no need for sympathy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Come on, you know how strong I
am, right?[A]
If you really want to take on Bern,
there's no better ally than me.[A]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Suit yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And so I will.
Well then, let's go, partner![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dieck...
I'm sorry.[A]
[0401]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bro...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry, you win.[A]
The other day I almost got killed, and
then I remembered what you told me.[A]
Maybe I was getting carried away...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So after that, I've been
following your advice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that you have, 'cause
you're still alive.[A]
If you can pay attention to the
bigger picture, you won't get[A]
killed so easy.[A]
With your strength, you can
impress people without always[A]
rushing in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bro, you okay?
You're like, praising me.[A]
It feels...weird.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, shut up.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[0404]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight]So...[A]
Looks like we're both still
alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Funny, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're mercenaries.[A]
We don't give a who wins, all
We care about are our money and[A]
our lives.[A]
We're best to just walk off
rather than stay and get killed.[A]
But...it's weird.[A]
We're going through all of these
incredibly tough battles, and I[A]
still don't feel like running
off.[A]
Roy...he makes me feel like I
can fight and die for his purpose[A]
and not have any regrets.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
I feel that way too.[A]
[0407]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Dieck![A]
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
But you shouldn't trust them
too much, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
That's different than what you
were saying before![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What I said was a guideline for
fighting.[A]
What I'm saying now is a guideline
for a mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]For a mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A mercenary has to fend for himself.
No one's gonna be looking out for you.[A]
You've got to be skeptical.[A]
You should even be wary that I might
be giving out orders just so I can[A]
ensure my own safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not a problem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You wouldn't be thinking things
like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You never know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.
So do Lott and Ward.[A]
That's why we can entrust our
lives to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't get cocky, kid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee...[A]
[040A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, about the other day...
I'm sorry.[A]
I said more than I should have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, I was so stupid.
But I don't want to stay ignorant.[A]
Right now I don't know anything
running a country, but I'll learn.[A]
I shall make Ostia a country in
which our children can always[A]
be happy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lady Lilina, please don't
strain yourself.[A]
My brothers are doing fine
thanks to the Ostian marquess.[A]
Even God can't save all
of the people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...[A]
My sister, wherever she is...[A]
She would have liked you very much.[A]
[040D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
Oh, I know.[A]
You just wanted to see that dance
so badly, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your dancing...[A]
I think I have seen it
somewhere before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
You have?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
A small band of entertainers once
stopped by my village when I was[A]
younger.[A]
I went to watch them...and a
little girl was dancing in the[A]
center.[A]
She tripped a few times and made
some mistakes, but she was trying[A]
really hard.[A]
I was going through some tough
times back then, but that girl's[A]
dancing kind of cheered me up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
I don't remember it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.[A]
You're probably cheering up
a lot of people with your[A]
dancing, where ever you go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Oujay.[A]
Tell you what.[A]
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Special...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's really amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow...it is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were thinking naughty
thoughts again, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No!
I wasn't![A]
[0410]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garret.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
You said you gave your bracelet
to that blind guy, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What would you do if you met
him again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
I guess I don't have to ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would get tricked just as
easily as you did before and[A]
do anything for him, I assume.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Why do you care so much for
total strangers?[A]
What are you gonna get from
helping them?[A]
You should just ignore them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...If I see someone in need, I
would feel that I want to do[A]
something to help him.[A]
If I met that old man again,
I would probably give him[A]
him something...again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Oh well, I guess some
people are just born stupid.[A][Clear]
Oh yeah...
I have to give you this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[ToggleSmile]?
What is this?[A]
It's beautiful...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dunno.[A]
Some old guy who said he'd met
you came up to me the other day.[A]
He asked me to give you this.[A]
He also said that he was really
grateful for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...
I met that old man way back in...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I don't know![A]
Anyway, he wanted me to give
this to you.[A]
Just take it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Garret...[A]
[0413]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it.[A]
Sailing seems like a worse
option whenever I hear about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You think so?
The sea's a great place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you're always on the water,
right?[A]
It's just endlessly blue[A]
wherever you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's true.[A]
When the sun comes up in the east...
or when it sets in the west...[A]
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Dawn is great as well,
but I prefer the sunset.[A]
When you're sailing towards
the setting sun, it's just...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you can't make any
money with the sunset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You have no aesthetic sense.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All right, I'll let you on my
ship sometime.[A]
You can't call yourself a true
sailor until you see that beauty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't going to
make me any money...[A]
[0416]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Lalum![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were just making fun of me,
weren't you![A]
You were teaching me how to
dance, huh?[A]
Well, that was nothing but a
load of crap![A]
When I danced in front of the
others, like you showed me, they[A]
all laughed their assess off![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Good![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What!?
Why you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look.[A]PNL
[0419]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You again?
Damnit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a bandit, like you say.[A]
I've plundered villages and killed
innocent people.[A]
But...let me say this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...I hate bandits as well...and
I hate the way I've been living[A]
like them.[A]
That's all.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.[A]
[041C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Hey, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
G...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Garret.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you that.
Here.[A]
I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa whoa...[A]
You didn't have to bring the whole
tree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well yeah, I do, but this
is going a little overboard...[A]
Ah well, who cares.
Thanks.[A]
You want some?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't eat.
I don't eat strange things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...And what's that supposed
to mean?[A]
Hm?[A]
...Looks like I better get going.
Come on, Gonzales.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[041F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You haven't changed your
fighting, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long are you going to
continue fighting like that?[A]
I understand what you're saying...
But if you die, it's all over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that.[A]
There is only so much I can do
on my own.[A]
But I'm a knight, therefore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...
[ToggleSmile]Shall I stay at your side?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You would...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-If I leave someone like you alone,
I get worried and...can't concentrate![A]
So if I support you from nearby,
it'll be easier for you, too, right?[A]
Or... am I not good enough...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are![A]
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...[A]
With you around, it seems that
I can stay out of harm's way.[A]
I can trust you to guard my back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]O-Oh...[A]
But...
I'm really all right for you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course!
You're a strong warrior.[A]
You're perfect to fight
alongside with.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I meant...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So...the point is that...
I'm the one by your side...and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Nothing, forget it...
Well, come on, let's go.[A]
We have to hurry, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, let's be off![A]
[0422]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Alan, your fighting has
been impressive lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am trying my best to change my
fighting style, as you told me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Hm, you seem able enough to
take over after me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am old.[A]
I must make way for the young
generation, for Roy.[A]
I want you to take care of Roy
in my place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-Me...?[A]
Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course not!
It is an honor![A]
I shall protect Master Roy with my life
and bring further prosperity to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm down.
I told you that your fire worried me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need to get all worked up.
Master Roy is still young.[A]
You must grow with him, as a
knight, and as a person.[A]
[0425]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Alan, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean about when we lose?[A]
Are you still saying that you're
going to sacrifice yourself,[A]
or something ludicrous like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I gave up that idea.[A]
...Your words were a slap in the face,
so to speak.[A]
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've been in Pherae the shortest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.
Except me, of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?
I really envy you sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course I have confidence.
How could I possibly lose to you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You'd better remember those words, for
you will be hearing them again from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha, never![A]
See you after the battle![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Even if we lose, you won't be the only one
staying behind and fighting to buy time![A]
You'd better remember that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
[0428]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Aaaarrr![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...![A]
[ToggleSmile]You're...getting better, Ward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Y...You too![A]
You become stronger every time
I see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm still weak.
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heh, then I'll become stronger
than that![A]
No matter how many enemies come out,
I'll crush them all with my axe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Enemies...[A]
Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, how?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think we can win?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
Of course we'll win.[A]
I'm on this side, after all.[A]
How could we lose?
And we've also got you.[A]
No enemy would stand a chance
against the two of us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Haha...
That's right, I forgot.[A]
There's no way we could lose.[A]
It isn't like me at all to get
worried like that.[A]
All right!
Charge![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh yeah!
Let's go get 'em![A]
[042B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy was telling me the other day
that you were telling him stories of[A]
other parts of the continent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If my experience can be of use to Master
Roy, then I shall do my best to teach him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Well, it seems that I can now
Retire without any worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not if we have you.[A]
You can take my place once
I am gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?
But I am not a native of Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still worrying yourself over
matters like that?[A]
Master Roy certainly isn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...All right, then I shall take your
place when the time comes.[A]
But that is in the far future.[A]
You are still well, and you must
still be our example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe I can.
One never knows.[A]
[042E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you see this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think we stand
a chance of winning?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I honestly don't know.
Well, we are outnumbered severely.[A]
The enemy can afford to send out new
troops all the time, while we have[A]
to be careful about losing even
one troop.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
Our starting conditions are just
so different.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Master Roy sometimes thinks of plans
that are beyond my petty thoughts.[A]
He has done miraculously well
in the battles so far.[A]
Under his direction, I feel like
we could never lose.[A]
Master Roy will surely lead
us to victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
... You're not the one to favor
somebody just because he's your master.[A]
So if you say so, it must be true.
Then I better start believing, too...[A]
[ToggleSmile]In our victory, and our leader.[A]
[0431]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia?
You look troubled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Percival...[A]
I was just wondering what will
become of Etruria after all this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just what you would think.[A]
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria will regain its former glory.[A]
It will become even more prosperous
than ever before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
We will make it happen with our
own hands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.[A]
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
You're right, Percival.[A]
[0434]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin.[A]
You were talking about your
songs for your future travels...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About the state of Etruria
after the prince passed away?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Will you be singing it in various
lands after the war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is what I intend to do.[A]
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course I will be.[A]
I expect my stay at Etruria to
be the longest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where will you go after you
visit the palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nowhere...[A]
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria for as long as[A]
I live.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do I have your word on that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I shall swear my honor on it.[A]
[0437]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Odd...[A]
She was nothing more than a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, it seems...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]...Lonely?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Really?
Yes![A]
I knew you liked having me around![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't lie.[A]
You said it just seemed
lonely without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No,
I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew it![A]
Not even General Percival can live
without my dancing.[A]
All right, I'll come to you every
morning from now on and give you a[A]
wake-up dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.[A]
[043A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
You seem to be in a good
mood, Sophia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I was speaking...to the other people
in the army...[A]
The outside people...
they are all kind...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...
That's nice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It would be nice...
if we could be friends...[A]
with the outside people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
But the elder told us not
to speak with outsiders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand what he's saying...[A]
The dragons' powers could easily
destroy entire countries.[A]
If the outsiders found out,
they would surely fight over it.[A]
I've seen many conflicts like
that in my life...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But...someday...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
If we can live together with
dragons, there should be no[A]
reason why the outsiders can't...[A]
[043D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay, I suppose the rejected man
should slink away now...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Golrois...![A]
...I mean, Astol.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Please look at this...[A]
My husband was carrying it when
I first met him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are these scribbles?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're not scribbles.[A]
This is an emblem given to
Lycian spies.[A]
I also did some research on what
kind of work they do...[A]And...
I now understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information that is
incredibly dangerous to the enemy[A]
if it is leaked.[A]
If a spy gets caught, the enemy will
dig deep down into his weaknesses.[A]
Family members and lovers are taken
as hostages...[A]
And the spy is put through endless
torture until he spills every bit of[A]
information that he has.[A]
That's why spies have to be alone...[A]
They must not make family or friends,
or lovers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry to say this to you, but...
That guy is dead.[A]
He was devoured by the quicksand of
Nabata.[A]
All this stuff about spies and whatnot...
It's just your imagination.[A]
Or perhaps you saw an illusion in the
desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I...see...[A]
Then...
I must have been dreaming...[A]
I must have had a dream of
a short period of happiness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Igrene.
...No...[A][Clear]
Sorry, forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just...forget it all.
...Please.[A] 
[0440]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus...
What does...[A]
What does Roy think of me?
I...[A]
I'm not so sure anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, he's...[A]
I've always...liked him...
for a long time now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why not go up to him and
find out for yourself, my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not have much experience in matters
like this, but I have heard the maids[A]
at the castle saying that it is no
longer the age that women should be[A]
sitting around waiting.[A]
Lady Lilina, if you were to advance
on to him first, Master Roy would[A]
surely fall for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Yes...
Yes.[A]
I'm the one who's known him
the longest.[A]
I can't lose to those
other girls![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina![A]
[0443]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
He didn't move an inch even when[A]
he saw I was making my escape.
So I ran.[A]
I was almost at the door, and Lord
Hector still stood there motionless.[A]
I didn't know what was going
on, and I turned around and[A]
yelled at him, 'I'm getting away!
You ain't gonna do anything!?'[A]
A heavy voice came back to me,
'Flee if you wish. You may keep[A]
the treasure as well.
But does that make you happy?[A]
Do you want to live your life
in the shadows in constant fear[A][Clear]
of being found? Is that really
what you want?'[A]
I ran like hell, m'lady. I fled
from the castle, from his voice.[A]
After that, I just walked around
the area aimlessly through the night.[A]
Dawn broke... and I found myself
in front of the castle.[A]
[Clear]
Lord Hector was standing there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Ever since then, I've been
working for him, m'lady.[A]
He changed me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So that's what happened...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina, I can say this
to anyone, at any time.[A]
Your father...
was truly an honorable man.[A]
[0446]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where did she go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Ward.[A]
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I told you to leave this part up
to me.[A]
That doesn't mean you just go flying
off on your own![A]
We have to listen to the leader's
orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if we sit around waiting for
orders, we could miss a big chance![A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you get it?![A]
What if you just dashed out on your
own into a bunch of enemy archers![A]
How come we always have to have people
like you who just don't think before[A]
they act...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
I thought you were angry about
me flying off on my own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![A]
We need to work as a team in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
T-That was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-W-What are you talking about![A]
N-N-No way![A]
I-I was just telling you how we
should act in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward, you're tripping over your words.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erg...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Gimme a break.[A]
That's not like you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...you're right.[A]
[0449]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight]Ward, you're acting strange lately.[A]
You got something to say to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't die.[A]
You better not die.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you were killed,
what would happen to Myu?[A]
She's still just a little girl, and
she'll be forced to live on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're the same.[A]
If you were killed, Mary
would be upset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure, like that bitch
is gonna get upset over me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really don't
feel that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It's not that 'I' won't die.
'We' won't die.[A]
Eventually, we'll go home,
back to our hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's just a rundown village
with dirty rivers and no green at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it's our hometown, and
there are people waiting for us there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're right.[A]
[044C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Well, we meet again.[A]
Well?[A]
Doesn't looking at my face make you
want to help out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But...[A]
When this war is over, it might be
a good idea to go back to my[A]
hometown.[A]
If I get bored, I might drop by
and help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have family back home?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah, I have an older sister
who's always yelling at me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
You're pretty stupid,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Stupid?[A]
What do you mean by stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got a home to return to.[A]
You've got someone waiting for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You can help us out if you want,
but you must go back home to[A]
your sister.[A]
Got it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah, you don't have to tell me...
Damn...older sister now...[A]
[044F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey, Lot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany.[A]
You seem to be doing well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See?[A]
I'm being more careful now,
right?[A]
I'm not just rushing in anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, compared to before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, just 'compared to
before', huh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something
to tell you, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
The things that you should be
careful of in battle![A]
Do you want to hear them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear
for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Okay...
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...[A]
Don't stress yourself
too much, big brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What the...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And that was from Lot's cute
little sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
Thany![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha![A]
[0452]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, how are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I'm still alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you die.
I'm counting on you to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.[A]
And also...[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[A]
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?[A]
Well, well aren't you the lucky
man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I'm planning on going home soon,
granted that I stay alive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about that again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemy is getting stronger
all the time.[A]
I don't know how much longer I
hold out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I know that we'll win in the end...[A]
But I don't know whether I'll be
able to go home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on,
don't be so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone of your age should be
enjoying life![A]
I know you're probably worrying about
your sister and all sorts of things.[A]
But you have to go running around
more freely.[A]
You'll probably run into walls and
hit your head from time to time,[A]
but that's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't think I want to be
hitting my head.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, even if you die,
I'll take care of things for you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you can go out and get
killed without any worries![A]
...You know?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]She seemed to be saying something
different than what she was originally[A]
talking about...[A]
But...was she trying to cheer me up?[A]
[0455]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Say nothing, Gonzales.[A]
I can tell by looking in your eyes.[A]
You have become strong.[A]
You have come a long way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you want to say,
Gonzales.[A]
And I completely agree with you.[A]
I'm happy that you have come
this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But it isn't over yet.[A]
The path to a true warrior is long
and hard.[A]
Now come, Gonzales.[A]
Let us go in search of further power![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[0458]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems we get along well.[A]
I feel I can bring out my true
strength when I'm fighting[A]
alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can also fight without worry
with you around.[A]
It's like...something big is
protecting me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, if I were to have a son, I would
have raised him into a fine young[A]
man like you.[A]
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From now on, think of me as your father
and feel free to tell me anything.[A]
Is that clear, son?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah...
Thank you very much.[A]
[045B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Our village was burned to
the ground in the war.[A]
A bunch of soldiers came and
ordered us to set our houses on fire.[A]
No one did... I mean, who would?
It was our home. Soon the[A]
soldiers got impatient and drew
their swords... That's when one[A]
of the villagers took a torch
and went around setting the[A]
place on fire. That coward...
was my father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]All of our houses and
crops were burned... And even[A]
then, all my father did was
stand there and watch. ...[A]
I've hated him ever since.
I swore to myself that I[A]
would never become a coward
who goes around bowing to[A]
power like that. That's why I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cath... you're wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one would enjoy burning
down their own village.[A]
But your father... he had
something he needed to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.[A]
But he was fighting all the same.
He was gritting his teeth and[A]
fighting to protect something[A]
that was more important than
his house and crops. ...[A]
He was fighting to protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...... Ha...[A]
I don't think so.
My father's just a coward.[A]
[ToggleSmile]He's nothing like you.[A]
But... I suppose I could think
of it that way...[A]
[045E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, I need to tell you
something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it, Ray?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I... I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.[A]
I... Uh...
I'll apologize for that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
I understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A-And![A]
I'll never disappear without
warning again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?[A]
Come on, please!![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is there a problem if
I'm near you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er...[A]
N-No, that's not the case,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
We never know how often we'll be
together once we grow up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If...[A]
If I don't make it through this war,
promise me you'll pick up the little[A]
ones at the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't say that.
We'll both survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah... you're right.[A]
Something's wrong with me today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't let you die.[A]
You're my brother, my only
brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Ray.[A]
[0461]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, about the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry![A]
You said you were all right, but I
just ignored you and... I'm sure you[A]
didn't like a kid being so arrogant...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot, why are you apologizing
after helping me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you seemed to have been avoiding
me after that, so I thought that maybe[A]
you were mad...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was embarrassed, what do
you think![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because...[A]
No one ever cared for me that much in
my whole life...[A]
My grandma was the one who raised me,
but she was one hell of a bitch.[A]
I've gotten injuries far worse than
this one, but she wouldn't use her[A]
[ToggleSmile]staves to heal me at all![A]
I was just so happy that you
seemed to be so concerned..[A]
Lugh, thanks, man.[A]
You're now my friend forever.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!![A]
[0464]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Miss Miledy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry I ran off
like that the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm glad you're speaking to
me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I didn't want things to end like
that.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to my story?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four, and
ever since then I've been living at an[A]
orphanage in Lycia.[A]
It was a tiny orphanage, with seven
kids and just one priest whom we[A]
called Father.[A]
The oldest kids were my twin brother
Ray, and another boy called Chad, and[A]
me, so we three would take care of
the little ones.[A]
We were poor, but we were still
happy.[A]
But ever since Bern started the war,
our lives changed.[A]
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...[A]
Chad... he started stealing food without
telling Father...[A]
Ray then got fed up with that lifestyle
and suddenly left one day without[A]
telling anybody.[A]
I... We hated Bern.[A]
Bern was the one that did this to us...
Bern killed Father...[A]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[A]
..Anger keeps you going more than
sorrow...[A]
Anger has kept me alive... so that I would
be able to protect the little ones...[A]
...Phew...[A]
So...for now, until this war ends...
I have to keep my anger towards Bern.[A]
...But, you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I would be so relieved if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.[A]
If you would let me, I want to
help you as your friend... Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Miss Miledy.[A]
[0467]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Gonzales![A]
What's wrong?[A]
Why are you avoiding me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sh... Shut up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah![A]
[OpenMidRight]G-Go away!
Go go go![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][ToggleMouthMove]Only hurt if talk...
I know...[A]
I ugly, you pretty...
I not same as you.[A]
But...I never forget.
I stay human thanks to you...[A]
I never forget.[A][Clear]
...Thank you...[A][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Li...lina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That word...
You use it when you are happy.[A]
You don't use it when
you're... leaving someone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...
Crying?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You too...
Why are you crying?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales...
I want to be with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me to go away...
Please...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...
I...I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhhh...[A]
[046A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandma![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I was trying to study dark
magic at first, but I couldn't[A]
seem to pick it up at all, while
that kid I was talking about was[A]
doing great just learning on his own.[A]
So I thought maybe I didn't have
the talent, so I just switched to[A]
anima magic.[A]
But the thing is, how can I not
have talent when I have your[A]
blood?[A]
So I was wondering if my old man
had the talent or not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your father had more talent with
dark magic than you could ever hope for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
That makes no sense.[A]
...Wait![A]
I got it![A]
That's it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you thinking now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not your real grandson, right!?
O-Ow![A]
What'd you do that for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm expressing my disgust at your
stupidity.[A]
You are indeed my grandson.[A]
I'm the one that brought you into
this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're kidding![A]
My good looks couldn't have
come from your wrinkled face![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.[A]
I would date men like you and dump
them after they spent all their[A]
money on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ouch...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your kindness comes from your father,
and your talent for anima magic comes[A]
from your mother.[A]
Your stupidity... that probably comes
from your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
My mom wasn't a Shaman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At first, I was determined to make
my son's wife a Shaman.[A]
But your mother was a fine young lady
with a distinct talent for anima magic,[A]
so I couldn't help but give in.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...I was proud of them both...
But they died so young.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You must be disappointed that all
you have left is a pathetic little[A]
grandson, eh, Grandma?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
The strange thing is, I'm not.[A]
I can't say how much I missed
yelling at you when you were gone.[A]
Maybe they really are cuter when
they're more troublesome.[A]
I certainly want you to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Grandma.[A]
[046D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll give you that gem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's none of your business.[A]
Anyway, I'm giving you that
in return for the spell book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nope.
I can't accept this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why not?[A]
The gem's enough to buy another
Resire book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't about money.
It's about my pride.[A]
...Let's see...
I want you to apologize to me.[A]
Then you can have the
spell book for free.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
I can't believe you're being so
stubborn over something so stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, so are you.[A]
All you have to do is say
you're sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I won't.[A]
I've paid you back with the
gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not taking it.[A]
You're going to be in my
debt until you apologize![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hmph...
Adults.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What a stubborn little brat.[A]
[0470]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again!?[A]
It doesn't matter how many times
you come.[A]
I'm not giving you this money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you still saying that?
Geez![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then stop trying to take it![A]
I mean, don't you already have
a ton of money if you're a thief?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Why would I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, right![A]
I see you running around looting
chests all the time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I give it all to the poor.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm a master thief, I have my
dignity.[A]
I would never even keep 1G of the
money I steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
Are you going to give the money you
take from me to the poor as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hey...[A]
You can have maybe a hundred...[A]
No...[A]
I can give you around half of this
money to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
I'm a master thief,
I have my dignity.[A]
I don't take offers
from other people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I said no.
I don't want it.[A]
Besides...[A][Clear]
I've already got your money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
What... what the hell!?
When did you switch...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Cass![A]
Wait![A]
Just wait a second, please![A]
[0473]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Well?
How's your studying going?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
Don't even have the time to talk,
eh?[A]
You're a rude one, and you don't
Know how to respect your elders.[A][Clear]
But you seem to be serious about
learning dark magic.[A]
Boy, why do you seek the power
of darkness?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...It's not like I have some grandiose
reason.[A]
I use dark magic for myself.[A]
I want to protect those I hold dear,
and destroy all those who oppose me.[A]
That's the power I seek.[A]
The power you're trying to obtain...[A]
It's not to be taken lightly.[A]
It can tilt the planet if used
incorrectly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...so?[A]
I'll blow up a planet or two any day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
Well said, boy.[A]
Now come... come into the
depths of darkness...[A][Clear]
Of course, you're going to
have to study that book first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Nothing.[A]
