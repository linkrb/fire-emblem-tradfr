[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150]Boss![A]
The residents of the castle have
hidden themselves inside![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x137]Heh, even Eliwood, the greatest
knight in Lycia, can't beat an[A]
illness, eh?[A][OpenMidRight]Hehehe..[A]
You were right when you said[A]
there wouldn't be many soldiers
around here because they're[A]
getting ready to take on Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, who do you think
I am?[A]
But you never know when
reinforcements are going to come.[A]
All right![A]
Kill off the guys in the castle
while we still got time![A]
Then the treasure is all ours![A]
[02]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151]Hehe, castles ain't the only
places with treasure.[A]
Let's go ransack the villages
and get some loot![A]
[03]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x156][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Eliwood![A]
The bandits from Bolm Mountain
are attacking us![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see... Blast![A]
If I weren't in this state,
I would teach them a lesson...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122][NormalPrint]Mister Eliwood...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina, you must hide somewhere.[A]
This castle is going to become
a battlefield.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]No, sir.
I will fight, too![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't be ridiculous.[A]
If something happened to you, I
wouldn't know what to say[A]
to Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]To my father?
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It's going to be all right.[A]
Roy should be almost here by now,
so if we can hold our own until[A]
then, we can drive off these bandits.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[04]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus![A]
I want you to send a messenger
to Roy informing him of this[A]
attack immediately![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Y-Yes sir![A][ClearFace]
[05]

[06]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?[A]
Why are you in such a hurry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy![A]
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118]WHAT!
Is Lord Eliwood safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attacks.[A]
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x109][NormalPrint]Excuse me, Lance, is it?[.....]
Is Lady Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you from Ostia?[A]
Lady Lilina is in the castle.[A]
She should be all right,[A]
as long as Lord Eliwood is with her,
but he can't last forever.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]No...[A]
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][FastPrint]Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must recapture the castle![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x11C]Wolt is right.
We must hurry![A][OpenRight][NormalPrint]Yeah.
You're right.[A][Clear]
[FastPrint][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]All right, let's go![A]
We're going to save those trapped
in the castle![A]
[07]

[08]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x137][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Dammit!
Reinforcements already?![A]
But they ain't gettin' to
the castle so easy![A]
[09]

[0A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hey hey![A]
Aren't you knights going to the
castle?[A]
This may not be much...[A]
But this is something we'd
really like to offer you.[A]
Please use it well![A]
[0B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F][CloseSpeechFast]It's awful...[A]
Soldiers from Bern were able
to cross the border...[A]
They laid an awful attack.[A]
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...[A]
He can no longer stand too well...[A]
[0C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x164][CloseSpeechFast]Hey![A]
If you wanna do well in battle
you better use the terrain wisely.[A]
Like if you're in a forest,
the trees will cover you![A]
There's no way enemies will have
an easy time in that situation.[A]

[0D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D][ToggleSmile]YOU! Guess what?[A]
Money is important![A]
If you don't have it,
your weapons will rust[A]
and you can't fight
without your weapons![A]
[0E]
[LoadFace][0x137][ToggleSmile]You damn idiots![A][Clear]
Can't you guys take on
these dastards?![A]
[0F]
[LoadFace][0x137][ToggleSmile]Wh.. What the..?!
S... Strong...[A]
[10]

[11]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Father![.....]
Lilina![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x156][ToggleSmile]Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122]Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Father!
Lilina![.....][A]
...
Thank goodness you're all right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Roy, thanks for
coming this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, father.
How is your health?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.
I'm still alive, see?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]But Roy, you do know why
I called you back here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am to take over your role of
leading Pherae's military and join[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
As you know, Bern has started
to conquer Lycia.[A]
We must follow the ancient rule and
send out our military to protect[A]
the land of Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I really didn't want to send you
out because you were still studying,[A]
but I'm not well... I would only
be a hindrance to everyone else.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Father...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Mister Eliwood,
I will accompany Roy![A]
My father is in charge of
Lycia's main army.[A]
And I could use my magic to be
of some help to Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]No, Lilina.
You must return to Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x122][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... Why?[A][.....]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]With Hector's absence, there is no one
currently sitting on the throne of Ostia.[A]
The people must be feeling uptight as well.[A]
You, being the daughter of the marquess,
must take the throne until Hector returns[A]
and ease the tension of the people.[A]
Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... No, sir.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Roy, first you must go to the Bern border
and meet with the mercenary group that[A]
I have arranged a contract with.[A]
I'll send Merlinus along with you...[.....][A]
He'll be very helpful with his knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for everything,
father.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You'll be fine.
You can do it![A]
Go and fight, and show them who you
are, the next Marquess of Pherae![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes![A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[12]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I have something to ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I know, my lady.[A]
I will accompany Roy in his travels
and swear to protect him with my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you, Bors.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[13]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][.....]Roy, be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know.[.....]
You too, Lilina.[A]
[14]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight]Roy, today I will instruct you
on basic battle tactics.[A]
[15]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
First, look at this.[A]
[Clear]
Do you see the moving square?[A]
[Clear]
This is the cursor.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][Clear]
You move your cursor to give out
commands to yourself and your allies.[A][.....]
Do you understand?[A]
Good, then let's get started.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions,[A]
But the best way to learn is to
actually experience a battle.[A]
Just try moving around for now.
I'll be here and give you advice as needed.[A]
[16]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]First, I'll tell you how to
win a battle. To win, you,[A]
Roy, have to capture the
the enemy's main defense[A]
point. That could be a castle
gate, a throne, or anywhere[A]
that the enemy leader is
positioned. For this session...[A][.....]
[17]
[LoadFace][0x134]...You must capture the castle gate,
where the cursor is at right now.[A]
I'll tell you how to capture
positions later, so make your way[A]
toward the castle gate. I'll
teach you how to move yourself[A]
around the map.[A]
[18]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]Do you see the unit in blue in the
top left? The blue units are those[A]
units are those on your side.[A]
"Units" are the people that
actually move around the map[A]
and fight.[A]
The red units are those on the
enemy side. All right then,[A]
let's try moving. You can
use the direction pad to[A]
to move your cursor around.
For now, it's positioned[A]
on you, so just press A.[A]
[19]
The area in blue is the
area in which
you can move. Use your[A]
cursor to select[A]
where you want to go,[A]
and press A to
move. If you change your[A]
mind, you can[A]
press B to cancel.[A]
Most things can be
cancelled by pressing B,[A]
so keep that[A]
in mind.[A]
[1A]
See the red area outside[A]
the blue zone?
The red zone indicates[A]
the area in which[A]
you can attack. Well, it[A]
seems that there
is an enemy unit in the red zone.[A]
[1B]
If you want to attack him,
you have to move a space next[A]
to the enemy unit. Select a
space and press A.[A]
[1C]
You can attack the[A]
enemy by selecting
"Attack" and pressing A.[A]
[1D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]If the enemy is still standing after
your attack, he'll retaliate. If one[A]
of you is particularly faster than
the other, you'll do a second attack.[A]
[1E]
Look at the red zone,[A]
or the attack range.
For you it was only[A]
one space, but now it's[A]
two spaces. That's because[A]
Wolt can attack
from distance with his bow.[A]
Indirect attacks[A]
are those done from a[A]
distance, and direct
attacks are those done[A]
right next to the enemy.[A]
Different weapons have different[A]
methods of attack.[A]
[1F]
Right now, you can do an
indirect attack with your bow.[A]
[20]
To launch an indirect attack,
you have to be one[A]
space away from[A]
your opponent. Try[A]
moving to one
of the spaces.[A]
[21]
Select "Attack" from
the menu and attack.[A]
[22]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
That was an indirect[A]
attack with a bow.
If you indirectly attack[A]
an enemy that has[A]
only close-range methods[A]
of combat, you
can hit him freely without[A]
fear of retaliation.[A]
However, on the downside,[A]
bows can't retaliate
against direct attacks.[A]
Don't forget that.[A]
[23]
Weapons like magic[A]
and Javelins can do
both direct and indirect[A]
attacks. You[A]
can see that the red[A]
zone is extended.[A]
[24]
Right now, you can launch
an attack with magic.[A]
[25]
You can either attack directly,
or keep your distance with magic.[A]
[26]
Select "Attack" to attack your opponent.
Also, do you remember the[A]
R button's function?[A]
You can hit R to see[A]
help messages here, too.[A]
[27]

[28]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]That was a magic attack.
You can attack from[A]
a distance to[A]
avoid retaliation from[A]
direct attacks,
and you can also go up[A]
close to avoid[A]
retaliation from bows.[A]
Isn't magic convenient?[A]
[29]
Choose which weapon to equip.[A]
[2A]
Choose which enemy to attack.
If there are multiple[A]
enemies in your[A]
attack range, use[A]
your cursor to
select the enemy you[A]
want to attack.[A]
For now, there's only[A]
one enemy,
so just press A.[A]
[2B]
Now, press A to attack![A]
[2C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
If you take a hit,[A]
your HP will be reduced.
HP indicates the life[A]
of a unit.[A]
If a unit's HP is[A]
reduced to zero,
that unit will die.[A]
Once a unit dies,[A]
he's gone for good.[A]
Also, if you die,
Roy, the battle is lost.[A]
Game over. So be careful.[A]
[2D]

[2E]
Do you see the "Visit" command?
If you select it[A]
and press A,[A]
you can visit the village.[A]
[2F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]If you visit villages,
you can gain items and money.[A]
You can use the items you
obtain with the "Item" command.[A]
[30]

[31]

[32]

[33]
[OpenMidRight]This is the status[A]
of this unit.
There are lots of them,[A]
like Strength[A]
and Skill, but I don't[A]
want to bore you
by explaining each one.[A]
If you want to know[A]
about them, press R to[A]
see the help message.
[Clear]All right, press B to return[A]
to the map...[A]
Oh, one more thing. If[A]
you hit the right and
left buttons on this[A]
screen, you can view[A]
more information about[A]
the unit, like his
items and skills.[A]
When you're done,[A]
press B to return to the map.[A]
[34]

[35]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]When the enemy's turn is done,
it's your turn again.[A]
The battle proceeds like this
in a turn-by-turn fashion.[A]
[36]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
All right,
I'm going to help Master Roy with my bow![A]
[37]
[LoadFace][0x134]Roy, Wolt came to help you.
You're not the only unit[A]
you can move.[A]
You have command over all[A]
of your allies,
but also remember that you[A]
are responsible[A]
for their lives.[A]
And one more thing...[......][A]
[38]
[LoadFace][0x134]Do you see where the cursor is?
This is the entrance[A]
to a village.[A]
Ordinary people live here,
so you have to inform them that[A]
a battle is going on.[A]
Move to the[A]
village and select
"Visit" to tell them.[A]
[39]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]Roy, are you all right?
I'll help you with my magic![A]
[3A]

[3B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Do you think have a[A]
good grasp on battle now?[A]
All right, now I'll tell[A]
you about a very[A]
important weapon...[A]
information. Almost
anywhere, you can[A]
press R to view help[A]
messages about things.[A]
For example, you can
move the cursor to a[A]
unit and press R to[A]
view his personal data.[A]
You can also press
R on the "Attack" and[A]
"End" commands to see[A]
help messages about them.[A]
If there's something
you're unsure of, just press R.[A]
[3C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134]
We're approaching[A]
the castle.[A]
Like I said before,[A]
you have to
capture the castle[A]
gate, where the[A]
enemy leader is[A]
positioned. Right
now it's Bors, so[A]
you have to go[A]
up and defeat him. Then,[A]
you have
to use the "Capture" command[A]
to win the battle.[A]
[3D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Good! You defeated[A]
the enemy leader.[A]
Now Roy has to move to the castle
gate and "Capture" it.[A]
[3E]
Do you see the "Capture" command?
Select it and press[A]
A to win the battle.[A]
[3F]
The "Rescue" command[A]
allows you to carry
your allies to protect[A]
them from harm.[A]
You can only rescue[A]
units that have a
lower Constitution than[A]
you. You can see[A]
your Constitution and[A]
Rescue statistics on
your personal data screen.[A]
When you rescue[A]
a unit, you can release[A]
them do a space
next to you by selecting[A]
the "Release"[A]
command. You can't do[A]
both at once, though.[A]
[40]
The "Trade" command[A]
allows you to trade
items with units next[A]
to you. If you[A]
select the command[A]
and press A, each
unit's inventory will[A]
be displayed. You[A]
select which items you[A]
want to trade with
the A button. If you[A]
just want to give or[A]
take items, trade the[A]
item with an empty
space. If you give all[A]
your weapons to[A]
another unit, you won't[A]
be able to fight,
so be careful.[A]
[41]

[42]
This is the unit menu.[A]
These are commands
that you can give to[A]
your units.[A]
Right now,[A]
the "Item" and "End" commands
are showing.
You can select which command[A]
to issue with[A]
the A button. The "Item" command
allows you[A]
to equip and use items.[A]
You can also discard[A]
items. If there's nothing to do,
select "End"[A]
to end that unit's turn. You can cancel using[A]
the B button.[A]
[43]

[44]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
How are you doing?[A]
I'll tell you about the map menu now.
Move the cursor to an empty space[A]
and press A. You can see what each
command does by using the R button.[A]
[45]
If you press A when the[A]
cursor is on an unoccupied space,[A]
the map menu appears. For now,[A]
look at the bottom command.[A]
You can choose "End" to end your[A]
phase before moving[A]
all of your units. Just select it and[A]
press A. If you want to return[A]
to the map, press B.[A]
[46]
[LoadFace][0x134]Roy...! How could you die?[A]
...Is what I would be saying if
this was a real battle.[A]
the battle is lost.[A]
Don't be discouraged...
we'll try again tomorrow.[A]
Let's go back and get some rest.[A]
[47]
[LoadFace][0x122]
Roy... If this was a real battle,[A]
I would be dead. Be careful in a
real fight, okay...?[A]
[48]
[LoadFace][0x10B]
M-Master Roy...[A]
This is only a training session,[A]
so I'm fine, but if this were[A]
a real battle, I would be dead.
Dead allies are gone forever,[A]
so please bare that in mind.[A]
[49]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
Thank you. Please don't forget to[A]
inform the villagers when a real
battle occurs as well.[A]
[4A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
Good, you've captured
the castle gate.[A]
That's the end of our
session for today.[A]
How did it feel?[A]
If you ever get caught
up in a real battle,[A]
just remember what
you learned.[A]
You'll be just fine.[A]
[4B]
[LoadFace][0x109]Ah, so you have made it here.
This is a training session,[A]
but a battle all the same.
I won't go easy on you![A]
[4C]
[LoadFace][0x109]W-Well... Very good.[A]
[4D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What I'm asking is where
the princess is![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-Yes Captain Miledy...[A]
I'm certain she was in her
room this morning.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]I've already heard that![A]

What I want to know is where the
the princess is at this moment![A][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Um... She's... Er...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We're almost going into
head on war with Lycia.[A]
What if something happens
to the princess?[A]
Can you take responsibility?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I never should have let her[.....]
Highness go down to the border[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]in the first place.[A]
I will return to Bern and inform
the king about this matter.[A]
I'll try not to make it into
a panic, so you must find the[A]
princess as soon as possible.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes ma'am![A]
[4E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Is Princess Guinevere
still with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir, she's under constant
monitoring in the basement room.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good.
Don't let her escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir...
Are you sure this is[A]
a good idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Don't worry![A]
Bern has plenty of enemies.[A]
The younger sister of King Zephiel...[A]
We'll be sure to get a hefty amount
of money by turning her in to one[A]
of their foes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We're not going to make it anywhere
by serving our country, anyway,[A]
so we're better off thinking of ways
to make money fast, no?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course sir.[A]
... But, there is one little
problem with that plan...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just received a report...
it seems that Princess Guinevere's[A]
servant has escaped...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?! [.....]You fool, why didn't[.....]
you say so earlier?[A][Clear]
Go search for her immediately![.....]
Don't let her get away![A]
[4F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,
it's around here somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is where we're supposed
to meet the mercenary band?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, though, it seems[A]
they aren't here yet.[A]
[Clear]Oh wait, I can see somebody
[.....]running this way...[A]

[50]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]
Watch out![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, excuse me!
I was in a hurry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
I'm fine, but are you okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's good that you're
not hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... You are from Lycia,
are you not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I am the son of the
Marquess of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Dear God!
I thank you for your guidance![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Please, could you help
me rescue my mistress?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened?[A]
[OpenRight]My mistress and I were
traveling to meet someone[A]
from the Lycia Alliance.[A]
However, while we were passing
through here, we fell into a[A]
a trap set by Rude, the lord
of the castle just east of here.[A]
We were captured.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]
Master Roy![A]
We must not get into unnecessary
entanglements with Bern now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But we can't neglect a person who has
come to meet someone from the Alliance.[A]
... But, it isn't smart to charge
into enemy fields either...[A][Clear]
...![A]
[51]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[ToggleSmile]There they are![.....][A]
Hey guys, over here!
Get the servant girl![A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't matter whether
she's dead or alive![A]
[52]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]Oh, no...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
Well, Merlinus, they attacked first.
We have to fight, don't we?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You won't pay heed of me,
now will you?[A]
I guess I can be witness to how
much you have learned in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Alright!
We're going to charge the castle![A]
Miss Ellen, you can
hide some place safe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F]No, I will accompany you.[A]
I cannot fight, but I
can heal wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Oh...
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm the one that got you
tangled up in this mess.[A]
Please let me be of some help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, but please
don't strain yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, thank you
for your consideration.[A]
[53]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][ToggleSmile]They should be around
here somewhere...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Thany, [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]could you go and check to see
if the Pherae Army is around here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure![A]
[54]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Dieck, who's our
client this time?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Pherae family,[.....]
one of the nobles of Lycia.[A]
The marquess's son is going to
join the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][ToggleSmile]So we're going up
against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]That's what it looks like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][FastPrint]A worthy opponent!
Time to show some skill, eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][ToggleSmile]Bern... this one's going to be tough.
Better be careful.[A]
[55]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I think I've found them!
[ToggleSmile]But it looks like they're[A]
fighting somebody down there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What, a battle's[.....]
already started?[A]
We better hurry![A]
[56]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you Roy
of the Pherae family?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm Dieck.[A]
I think you've heard the news
from an old guy named Merlinus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're the leader
of the mercenary band?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]It's just a little group, really.
I'm sorry we're late,[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I didn't think that a
battle was already going on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well...
We have our issues...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No no, we're not blaming
you for it.[A]
Actually, everyone's all excited
and saying that they can show[A]
off their skills already.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thank you.
That is encouraging to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]All right then, let's get
this battle over with, shall we?[A]
[57]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]Welcome![A]
I don't have much to say,
for I am not that cool...[A]
But beware of Pegasi
and arrows![A]
They can take them down
in a single hit![A]
[58]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]Oh, you really saved us!
If those people got into our village,[A]
I don't know what would have
happened to this precious sword![A]
I was really scared...[A]
[59]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x165]A bow has great power
against flying enemies.[A]
If they get close,
you can tear 'em apart![A]
[5A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]The three weapons...
Swords, axes and spears.[A]
Remember, boy, swords beat axes,
axes beat spears,[A]
and spears beat swords![A]
Just remember that and
you will have an easy time![A]
[5B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]The forts are the key to this kingdom's defense.
If you're there, it's much easier.[A]
The enemy will miss easily,[A]
and the damage will be reduced.
Also, your wounds are slightly healed.[A]
[5C]
[LoadFace][0x138][ToggleSmile]Damn![A]
Just when I thought
luck was with me...[A]
[5D]
[LoadFace][0x138][ToggleSmile]Ugh... Greed... Only...
Brings you ill fate...[A]
[5E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
We have rescued a lady trapped
in the basement![A]
[OpenRight]That must be Ellen's mistress.
Have her come here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[ToggleSmile][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]
[5F]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10F]Your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellen!
Oh, are you all right?[A]
[ToggleSmile]I never thought you would
do such a brave thing for me...[A]
You had me worried, Ellen.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I wanted to rescue you
no matter what... So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is fine, Ellen.
Thanks to you, I am safe now.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[60]
[OpenMidLeft]I am in your debt.
May I ask your name..?[A]
[OpenRight]I am Roy, son of Eliwood,
the Marquess of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
And I am...[A]
[61]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]Your Highness...
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is all right, Ellen.
My name is...[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[62]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Guinevere.[A]
[OpenRight]Guinevere?!
That's impossible![A]
That's the name of the
Princess of Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is who I am.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]What![A]
[.....]Do you plan on
attacking us now!?[A]
[OpenRight]Merlinus, wait a second.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]I beg your pardon,
Lord Roy, but...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I want to speak with her.
Give me some time, will you?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Hmph, if Master Roy says so...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]You are indeed
Princess Guinevere from Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I am not sure if you will
believe me, however.[A]
[OpenRight]Even if you are not the
Princess of Bern, I can tell from[A]
your actions and your dress that
you are certainly someone of high[A]
social status.[A]
But... if you are indeed
Princess Guinevere something[A]
doesn't seem right.[A]
Ellen told me you are intended to
meet someone from the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is correct.[A]
[OpenRight]Why, if you are
the Princess of Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to find a peaceful
way of ending the war.[A]
I figured if I could speak
to someone from Lycia,[A]
I could find some solution.[A]
[OpenRight]Your brother started this war.
Is it in your power to stop it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I certainly wish to stop it...
No, it must be stopped.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]... I see.[A]
Anyway, will you come with us to
meet the Lycia Alliance Army?[A]
I want to meet Lord Hector and see
what he thinks about this matter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Honestly...
You will take me?[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
If there is a possibility to avoid[A]
bloodshed and end this war,[A]
then I believe that we must try it,
no matter how small the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you![A]
Thank you... truly.[A]
[63]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][FastPrint][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty,[.....]
we have captured the enemy leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.
Bring him before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1BF]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]You...[A]
Zephiel, the King of Bern!!![A]
Damn you...![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ah, Lord Hector.[A]
I must praise your ability of putting
up such a good fight against[A]
two of our Dragon Lords.[A]
I suppose they do not call you
the leader of the Lycia Alliance[A]
for nothing.[A]
However, you were not good enough.[A]
Pray while you can,
for you end here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Bern and Lycia...
We were always on good terms with[A]
each other.[A]
Even when you took the throne,[A]
we have always paid our respects[A]
towards Bern...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Respect?
[ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous.[A]
Lycia... no, this entire continent
must go under my rule.[A]
That is the only way to
liberate this world.[A]
I lack the time to be worrying
about such trivial matters as[A]
respect.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]To liberate... this world?[A]
What do you mean...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is of no importance to you.[A]
You are going to die anyway.
Someone![A]
Take him away![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Throw Lord Hector
into the dungeon![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes sir![A][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][CloseSpeechFast]Your Majesty, I will now
return to the Sacae Plains.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, you may be on your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... One thing before I leave, your Majesty.[A]
I beg your pardon, but I do not
think that it is such a good idea[A]
to put too much trust into
sinister people...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Do you mean Idoun?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
Our soldiers call her the 'Dark Priestess'
and do not approve of her presence.[A]
I understand that she is a Shaman
of great powers, however...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brenya,[.....]
do you not have faith in me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...! Yes, of course I do,[.....]
your Majesty![A]
I just thought that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then all you do is
follow my orders.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Yes.[.....]
I will do whatever his Majesty
wishes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
'Do you not have faith in me?'
Dear, dear, the things I[A]
say sometimes...[A]
[64]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So Lord Hector is
still alive?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's for sure.[A]
I saw some of Bern's soldiers
take him into the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, was it?[A]
Do you know the inside
of Castle Araphen well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess.[A]
... Wait, are you guys planning on
going in to save Lord Hector?[A]
I wouldn't try that if I were you.[A]
The bulk of Bern's forces are gone,[A]
but there are still a decent number
of soldiers in the castle,[A]
you know?[A]
It would be suicide to try
and charge them with your army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps.[A]
But we can't afford to lose
Lord Hector.[A]
And you said that their main
forces are gone, right?[A]
Then there is a chance we could win.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Then I guess I'll go along too.
I can show you around[A]
the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?!
No, no, don't feel pressured![A]
If you could just explain what the
interior of the castle looks like...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I also want revenge against Bern.[A]
C'mon, let me go with you![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]All right.[A]
Then I'll be counting on you.[.....][A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course!
Leave locked chests and doors to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Master Roy...[A][.....]
I beg your forgiveness of my
brother's doings...[A]
I didn't think he would invade
Lycia so soon...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]My Lady, there's no point
in dwelling over the past.[A]
Please do not blame yourself.
Besides, Lycia is still intact.[A]
If we could get our leader,
Lord Hector, out of harm's way,[A][Clear]
we can unite Lycia once again
and fight![A]
We must recapture Castle Araphen for all
of our sakes... and for Lilina's[A]
sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's go![A]
[65]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1C1][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thanks for taking care of
the children, Reverend.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
We of the Elimine Church will take
good care of the orphans.[A]
And what will you do, Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm going to stay here.
I still have some things to do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see...[.....]
Please do not stress yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x167][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x166][OpenMidRight]Make sure you listen to what
the priest says, okay?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Aren't you coming with us,
Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm going to wait for Chad,
and then we'll catch up with you...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yay!
Chad's coming too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]That's right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Then I want [....]Ray[....]
to come too![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
It would be great if Ray came
back and we could all go[A]
together, wouldn't it?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x1C1][CloseSpeechFast]Children,
we must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
[OpenFarLeft]See you later,[....]
Lugh.[A]
[OpenLeft]Hurry and catch up, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Sure...
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry...[A]
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.[A]
[66]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Narshen!
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]What is causing all that noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Probably what's left of the
enemy are trying to put up a[.....][A]
fight in their last hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Your Highness,
shall we use the Dragons?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No, I do not wish to put the
Dark Priestess through any trouble.[A]
Do not worry, we can handle them
by ourselves...[A][OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Not this time, Idoun.[.....][A]
Send the Dragons back to Bern,
as we planned.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes,[....]
if his Highness wishes it to be so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x149][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I will be off to Bern soon as well.[A]
Narshen, I'm going to leave Lycia
up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... What shall I do with the remaining
forces of the Lycia Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Kill all those that
stand against us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Does that include
women and children?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[.....]Annihilate them enough so that they
would no longer even think about[A]
going against us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave that to me, sire.[.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hehehe...[A]
[67]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x139][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, I wonder what his Majesty sees
in that Idoun girl.[A]
Well, I think I'll be going as well.[A][.....]
Slater, I'm trusting this castle
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you leaving?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
One of the marquesses who turned[A]
against Lycia has a special gift
for me.[A]
He says it's a girl from Etrurian[A]
nobility or something...
Hehehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From Etruria?
She must be very beautiful, then![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, the marquess tells me she's still
young but very beautiful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would be looking forward to it
if I were you, sir.[A]
Please be careful on your
way there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You be careful too, Slater.[A]
Don't you dare get defeated[A]
by these remainders of Lycia's

If you do, I will personally
tear you apart.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Lugh, don't force yourself.[.....]
You can't hurt people, can you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Father.

[OpenFarLeft]It's all right...
I won't last much longer...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]I was taken by surprise...[A]
I never would have guessed that Bern[A]

[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Dragons!?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
The Dragons that we humans fought
in the past...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The Scouring?
I have heard of it.[A]
A long time ago, two races that
each had half of Elibe, the humans and[A]
the Dragons, fought over total control
of the continent...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Right... the "Eight Heroes"...
defeated the Dragons and led us[A]
humans... to... victory...[.....][A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How did Bern use the Dragons...?[A][OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I... have no idea... But...[A]
the Dragons had control of what
is now Bern in the past...[A]
and Hartmut, one of the Eight Heroes
... is the founder of Bern...[A]
Perhaps... the reason... lies
there...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Roy... Go to Ostia...![A]
... You must... lead what is left

[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry... in Ostia...[A]
are weapons that... are

to come to our side yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no future for us
if we are to be chained down by[A]
old, moldy traditions, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That, my friend, is a wise
way of thinking.[A]
Now, where is the gift that
you promised me?[A]
She does not seem to be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes!
I have prepared her in a separate room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She is a naive girl, you see.[A]
When I told her that I would
let her meet her brother,[A]
she came right along with us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You, over there!
Bring her here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x103]What, is this room?
Where is my brother, Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Welcome, Lady Clarine.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Narshen, one of Bern's
Three Dragon Lords.[A]
My Lady, I shall play with you
instead of your brother.[A]
[MoveRight]Hehehe...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Hahahahaha![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]?[A]
What is so amusing,
my lady?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You?
Instead of my brother?[A]
Take a good look in the mirror.[A]
Your clothing, your hair, your speech...[A]
every aspect of you completely
lacks finesse.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lacks finesse?!
Me, lacking finesse?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Comparing you and my brother is
like comparing a turkey to a peacock![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You, you vermin!![A]
Saying that I lack finesse,
of all things![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Sir Narshen, I have just received a
report that Castle Araphen has been[A]
retaken by the enemy![A]
[OpenRight]What!
What happened to Slater?[A]
[OpenLeft]Er...
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.[A]
The enemy has been reported as Roy,
son of the Marquess of Pherae.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x103][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Damn![A]
Lord Eric, lock the girl up
in some cell.[A]
I shall have much 'fun' with
her when I return![A]
You, close down the highroad leading
to Ostia.[A]
This Roy figure might pass by.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Yes sir![A]
[70]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151][NormalPrint]Heh... all this crap about Lycia
and Bern or whatever.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]People of nobility have so much
to worry about.[A]
Well, we can't complain 'cause
we make our living off of turmoil.[A]
Hehehe...[A]
[71]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]They shall pay for locking
me up in here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]... Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is someone there?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][CloseSpeechFast]I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Eric.[A]
He wants to see you.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]I refuse.[A]
I do not wish to meet with
such lower class people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]...
Just get over here.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Let go! You shall pay!
Do you know who I am?![A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Let go, I say![A]
[72]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I said,
let go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Shut up.
You won't be able to escape[A]
with all the noise you're making.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]![.....]
Then you're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I've prepared a horse for you
over there by that tree.[A]
Get on it and leave while
you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...[.....]
Why are you helping me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I have hatred against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hatred?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's none of your business.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Putting it that way only
makes me more curious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Time's running short.
Go![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[73]
[LoadFace][0x114][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[74]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][ToggleSmile]This is in the middle of a battlefield!
What was that man thinking?![A]
A proper gentleman should escort
the lady to her mansion![A]
Well, putting that aside...
I came all the way here on my own[A]
to meet my brother, and now look
at the state I'm in...[A]
What should I do now?[A]
[75]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah,[.....]
there you are![A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our forces are having trouble[.....]
out there.[A]
Take some more troops and assist
them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Didn't you hear?
I said to go help them![A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard you.
I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph, not the friendliest of people.[A][.....]
Well, he's supposed to be one of the
best swordsmen out there.[A]
[76]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Pardon me,

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Who else?[A]
You are the leader of
this group, are you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]That is most convenient.[A]
All right then,
you are to protect me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you deaf?[A]
I said that you are going
to protect me from harm.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]Mind your mouth,
young lady![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Please step back.
I was not addressing you.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
Who do you think...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint]Now, now, Merlinus...[A]
It looks like she's being pursued by
the castle's soldiers.[A]
That's why she wants us to guard
her.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, yes![A]
That is correct...[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x154]
What... what impudence!
Our army isn't so lenient that[A]
we are going to take along some girl
who would be of absolutely no use![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]My name is Clarine,
not 'girl'.[A]
And I am not of no use![A]
I can use these staves to heal
wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint]So you will fight alongside us?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Yes![A]
Of course... I would certainly not
ask to be protected without doing[A]
anything in return![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you for joining![A]
We're going up against Bern,
so we need all the people we[A]
can recruit.[A]
I'm Roy.
Pleased to meet you, Clarine.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I am also pleased...[A]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmph! 
I will not be friendly with you...[A]
[77]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh![.....]
You are...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What,
you're still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]"Still here"?[A]
You just abandon me in the middle
of a battlefield, and you still[A]
have the nerve to say that?!
I could have been killed![A][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then you're lucky that[A]
you're still alive.
Is there anything else you need[A]
to say to me?[A]
[OpenRight]Just a minute![A]
You are just going to
walk away after abandoning me?[A]
I do not think so.[A]
A proper gentleman should take
responsibility for his actions.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Responsibility?[.....]
What responsibility?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]If a gentleman rescues a lady,[A]
he must also escort her to her
mansion![A]
I've never heard any story from[A]
any barf of a man just abandoning
the lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What in the world
are you talking about?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Besides, do you not have a
grudge against Bern?[A]
Then you shouldn't be trying to
fight us, who are going up[A]
against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What?
Wait![.....][A]
Is that true?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]?[.....]
Is what true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Is the army that you're in
really fighting against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... the leader named
Roy or something said so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...
All right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I'm going to join your army.
Happy now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ah... I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
The most important thing is not
to fight Bern, but to protect me![A]
[78]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x166]
If you don't have a thief,
you won't be able to open[A]
chests and doors.[A]
Only a thief can use Lockpicks.
But I have a key called[A]
the Door Key, which can open
any door if anyone uses it.[A]
You should thank me.[A]
[79]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D][ToggleSmile]Everyone here is your ally.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're not about to abandon
the land in which we were[A]
born in and change sides.
[OpenMidRight]Please take this treasured sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was given to us generations ago.
A gift from the king.[A]
[7A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15D]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe this war is happening...[A]
Under Bern's leadership,
we will definitely wither.[A]
Here is something that will
help you stand longer.[A]
Think carefully before using it.[A]
[7B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x162]The mountain bandits and
pirates attack towns.[A]
Once they destroy a town,
there won't be anything left.[A]
Save the towns![A]
[7C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x164]In the Laus army,
there are mounted soldiers
who use bows.[A]
This is the nomad tribe.[A]
Everyone wants their military might
nowadays..[A]
[7D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you know the main point
of combat?[A]
There are weapons known as
Buster weapons, which defy[A]
the weapon triangle![A]
[7E]
[LoadFace][0x13A]You fools who are bound down
by old, moldy tradition![A][Clear]
I shall teach you
the ways of the world![A]

[LoadFace][0x13A]Ha...haha... Fools...[A]
There is no future for
those... who try and oppose
absolute power...[A]
[80]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
The Laus soldiers are retreating.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, good.
Tell everyone to get some rest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][.....][LoadFace][0x157]Roy...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have never guessed
that Lord Eric would turn to[A]
Bern's side.[A]
I thought the members of the[A]
Lycia Alliance had a strong
bonding to each other.[A]
Damn Bern!
Playing dirty like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I'm sorry![A]
I wasn't even thinking
about your feelings...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No... you are right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We will now proceed west towards
Ostia.[A]
But we can no longer trust the other
marquesses and now that Lord Hector[A]
has passed away, there may
no longer be a peaceful way[A]
to end this war.[A]
My lady, do you plan on returning
to Bern?[A]
If you need anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, please allow me to stay,
if it would not be a burden.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It would never be a burden!
But why do you wish to stay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My brother is wrong.[A]
He is dragging the Dragons
into a human war.[A]
If he thinks that is the way to
liberate the world, I must stop him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To liberate the world?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, he has always been talking
about liberating the world.[A]
He is saying that this war is
to do so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does he mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know...[A]
But my brother is not the kind[A]
of person that would think
about taking over the world.[A]
So he must have a very important
reason for conquering Elibe.[A]
Still, that is no excuse to cause
war, killing innocent people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere...[A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]All right, then let's go on our
usual visit down to the village[A]
and gather up all the loot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, but boss, something's[A]
different today.[A]
There's an army stationed real
close to us![A]
They look like Lycia's troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lycia? Then that ain't a problem...
They gotta be the remainders[A]
of the army that got[A]
their ass kicked by Bern.[A]
Then we can beat them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, boss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, we still gotta[A]
take our precautions.
Maybe we can rake up some loot[A]
from them too![A]
All right boys,
let's take 'em on![A]

How may I help you?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Sir![A]
We wish for you to defeat
the bandits here![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Bandits?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]There's a pack of bandits that have
made their base in an old castle[A]
near the cliffs.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where are the castle guards?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]They fled once they heard
that Lycia lost to Bern...[A]
We villagers were left behind.[A]
We spend our days in fear of
bandit attacks.[A]

Please make use of the gate.[A]

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]She fled because you advanced upon us
with such a scary look on your face.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is the face I was born with![A]
Father Saul,
you were hitting on another girl.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You make it sound so evil!

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Why does that have to be tonight?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Well, putting that aside...
Did you not have something to tell me?[A]

[OpenMidRight]Hold on, you.[A]
Why don't you take this spear with you?
I think at some point a really[A]

Just a rumor, but he
bested many soldiers with[A]
this lance![A]

[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy, I will be fine.
I also wish to meet this priest.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Princess?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]The relationship between my brother and

[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces][ToggleMouthMove]Ahem... Your Highness,[A]
I wish to know the location of the
'Fire Emblem.'[A]
You have it with you,
do you not?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]!![ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]How did you know that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The Head Church in Bern informed[A]
us that the Fire Emblem
had mysteriously disappeared[A]
from the Temple of Seals.
They also informed me that you left[A]
at exactly the same time.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was sent by the Church to
confirm the truth.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Why did you take the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]... I wished to stop my brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your brother... Zephiel,
the king of Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you know what the
Fire Emblem is used for?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Fire Emblem is a key that
awakens the sword that was used[A]
to slay the mighty Dragons in the past.[A]
Or, that was what my father told me.[A]
But I am unsure about how exactly the
Fire Emblem or the sword work.[A]
However, the possibility of the Fire Emblem
falling into enemy hands seemed[A]
to worry my brother... a lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you took the Fire Emblem, hoping
that to make your brother believe[A]
it fell into enemy hands so that
he would stop his conquest?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes... but war broke out anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a representative of the
Elimine Church, I wish to ask[A]
you this:
What do you plan to do from here?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...Must I answer
at this moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Yes. I have not given up hope
of settling this war without[A]
bloodshed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
In that case, please allow me to
accompany your journey.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]I apologize, Roy.[A]
[8D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]Well, sneaking in here was fine,
but there's nothing worth stealing![A]
Hmm, the room to the north seems
to have treasure, but the[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]... Are those footsteps?[A][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1E3][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I trust everything is under control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our soldiers are stationed

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lead them into the castle

just as we did with Lord Orun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want Princess Guinevere alive.[A]

Now go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hahahaha...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The 'Silver Wolf's' granddaughter,

Bern will be sure to allow[A]
us on their side.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x12C][MoveMidRight]Hmmm...[.....]
Now this is getting interesting.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wonder.[A]
That man said he was
Lord Orun's advisor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wagner?
Does he bother you in any way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He seemed to be in control of
everything, as if he owned the place.[A]
And we can't even go near Lord Orun
because he's ill?[A]
Something seems wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm... come to think of it, you
do have a point, Master Roy.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][CloseSpeechFast]Excuse me, Master Roy.[A]
There seems to be an awful lot of
soldiers patrolling the area.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10C]I think we're being spied on.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?
No...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][CloseSpeechFast]You noticed?
Impressive.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]!?
Show yourself, intruder![A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hi![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]And... who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Aw, we can talk about me later.[A]
You know, I was overhearing that Wagner
guy's conversation in the main[A]
main hall, and they said they're
going to ambush you guys.[A]

[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Orun would never do that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, that person's dead.[A]
That dark magician assassinated
him or something.[A]
[OpenRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]And he's going to capture you
guys and turn you into Bern so[A]
they can join up with them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x154][ToggleSmile]Hold it, Master Roy![A]
Don't trust people like this
so easily![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You can believe me or not,
it's up to you.[A]
But don't come crying to me when
you find yourselves in trouble![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x157][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Roy...
If what she says is true...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's set a trap.
We'll pretend like we're leaving.[A]
if Wagner is after us, he'll do
something to persuade us to stay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you're gonna go outside,
use the room in the north![A]
That room leads to the courtyard,[A]
so you'll be out of here in
no time.[A]
Good luck![A]
[8F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1E3][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Master Roy!
Where are you going?[A]
We will escort you into the castle,[A]
so please come this way.[A]
[OpenFarRight]My apologies, sir,[A]
but I have just received a report
of a matter of importance.[A]
Excuse us, but we must be going now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh... But I surely cannot see you
off without paying my respects and[A]
offering you a place to stay!
Lord Orun would never forgive[A]
me for that![A]
Please, Master Roy, will you not
just spend one night here with us?[A][OpenFarRight]Do not worry, I shall tell Lord
Orun myself that you are[A]
not to blame.[A]
I ought to pay my respects
to him, anyway.[A]
Please show us to his room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like I said, Master Roy, Lord
Orun is ill and cannot see you.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I am sorry, sir, but if we
cannot see him, then we have[A]
have no reason to stay here.[A]
We are in a hurry.[A]
Excuse us,
but we must be off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]You are leaving...
No matter what?[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Then I have no choice but
to kill you now![A]
Everyone! Attack![A]
Kill them all, but leave
Princess Guinevere alive![A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]Damn!
So they were after us![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E]Master Roy![A]
Even if we escape this way,
we'll just be attacked from behind![A]
[OpenRight]Then we'll take over this castle!
Everyone, follow me![A]
[90]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][FastPrint]Whoo,
they're at each other's[A]
throats now.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]'Suppose I'll take what[A]
I can while I can.[A]
[91]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]All this noise...[A][Clear]
A battle?
What is going on outside?[A]
[92]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?
What's a girl doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?...
You aren't a person from the castle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who are you?
Oh, my name is Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Sue.
Are you causing the noise outside?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The noise of a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Oh yes.[A]
We're fighting denizens of
the castle.[A]
It's a long story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see.
Then I am on your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]This castle's residents are
my enemies as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What do you mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please give me a bow.[A]
I will fight alongside you.[A]
[93]
[LoadFace][0x1E3][ToggleSmile]Damn you,
useless vassals![A]
Well then,
I have no choice.[A][Clear]
Witness my magic...[A]
And bow down before
its power![A]
[94]
[LoadFace][0x1E3]
[ToggleSmile]No...[A]
My plan...
was flawless...[A]
[95]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... So you're the granddaughter of the
leader of one of the clans in Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Grandpa is the strongest warrior
in Sacae.[A]
People call him the
'Silver Wolf.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Silver Wolf...
I have heard of him.[A]
But what are you doing in Lycia?
Sacae is to the east.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern invaded Sacae, so we of the
Kutolah clan have decided to fight.[A]
So grandpa let the women and
children escape to Lycia, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There was a traitor.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]The Djute clan, who have turned
to Bern's side, ambushed us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]We were all separated.[A]
I found my way into these lands
and I was rescued by Lord Orun.[A]
But his advisor, Wagner, assassinated
Lord Orun and took over the castle.[A][OpenMidRight]And then you were captured...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is your army fighting Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Bern has invaded
our lands as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then let me go with you.[A]
Fighting Bern will let
me rescue grandpa.[A]
I also want to avenge
Lord Orun.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're headed for Ostia.[A]
It's in the opposite direction
as Sacae, so is this okay[A]
with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't mind.
No matter where we are,[A]
neither our Mother the Earth
or our Father the Sky[A]
will ever disappear.[A]
[96]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
The spy I sent to Ostia has just
returned, and he says that Ostia[A]
is in a state of chaos![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's been a rebellion among
those who want to surrender to Bern.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The spy says that she has
been taken as a hostage.[A]
Currently, the rebel group has taken
over Castle Ostia and are fighting[A]
the soldiers who wish to retake
the castle and Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We must hurry to Ostia!
Lilina, please be safe![A]
[97]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! You're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oops...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, what do you think
you're doing?[A]
Let go of my arm![A]
Ow! That hurts![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
But...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, um, you know,
it's complicated.[A]
I have things to do, you see?
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Things to do? Here?
In a battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dummy, it's because this is a
battlefield...[A]
... Whoops, better watch my tongue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have some motive
that we're unaware of?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ulp..[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that why you
told us the escape route...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, what?[A]
I have no idea what
you're talking about![A]
[OpenMidRight]Who are you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now, now, don't worry
about such trivial things![A][Clear]
Oh, I gotta go. Bye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait![A]
[98]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Crap...
Er, what a coincidence![A]
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...If you're in the battlefield
just to steal, you shouldn't be.[A]
It's not right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.[A]
I only take from the rich who
have plenty of money.[A]
No one's going to starve or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not the point.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh really?
Then let me ask you this.[A]
You nobles take food and money
from the people living in what[A]
you call your territory.[A]
Who said that was your land, anyway?[A]
And you say you're collecting
taxes, but what you're doing is[A]
the same.
Looting![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
But we protect the people
in return...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're not![A]
You're killing your own people,
causing a war like this![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well.. Bern started to invade,
so we had to fight to defend[A]
our people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you can just do anything
you want, as long as you say[A]
you're protecting us?[A]
You can burn down villages
and ruin our crops?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Burned?
We never... ![A]
Wait a minute, was your...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...My village was burned to
the ground by our marquess.[A]
He said that he had no choice
because he needed to prepare for[A]
Bern's attacks.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well... that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We always had just enough to
eat and survive, and then we[A]
just lost everything...
Our homes... our crops...[A]
And then you say not to take from
other people?[A]
Ha! You shouldn't be talking!
You dastards from the nobility[A]
take from us so you can live
in luxury while we suffer![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
don't know what to say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh. We're getting all gloomy now.[A]
I really don't like talking about
'I'm worse off so you should pity me'[A]
arguments.[A]
But you're the one who started it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, to heck with this.[A]
It's no fun stealing after a
talk like that.[A]
Well, I guess I better bail
out then.[A][Clear]
See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[99]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! You're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? ...You again?[A]
These days, you always appear
to screw up my plans.[A]
Do you have something against me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I just... wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The last time we met, I said
some pretty harsh things.[A]
Like calling you a villain when
I didn't know the things you had[A]
gone through...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that? It's okay.
It's not really bothering me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I still think what[A]
you're doing isn't right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've really got nerve to
say that, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So would you give
me a chance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Once this war is over, I'll promise to
rebuild the villages that were damaged[A]
because of it.[A]
I'll be sure to make good use of
the taxes that they pay.[A]
So until then, I'd like you
to stop stealing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...[.....]
How long would that be?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When this war is over.
I can't exactly say when...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you expect me to wait
patiently until then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
Would that be okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?
Why do you tell me this?[A]
Why do you try so hard to
help someone like me?[A]
You should just leave a burglar
like me alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Without you, we wouldn't have
been able to escape Wagner's castle.[A]
Though you probably weren't trying
to help us, you did and you saved[A]
our lives.[A]
We can't just leave our benefactor
alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well well, at the rate
you're going...[A]
I guess you'll be getting in my way,
no matter where I go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]As long as you
appear in our path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, you win.[A]
I'll stop coming to battlefields
to steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Thanks for understanding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But, you have to let
me go along with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Actions speak louder
than words.[A]
I have to see whether you're going
to be true to your words or not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right![A]
[9A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Devias, how is the city doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They've been quiet so far, sir.[A]
But the mercenary knights from Ilia that
Hector hired are showing no submission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph! What's wrong with them?
We're telling them we'll pay more![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Ilia's mercenary knights are
known never to betray their masters.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You fool![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]I know that![A]
General Narshen is going
to arrive soon![A]
If we don't have Ostia
under our control by then,[A]
he'll laugh at us![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]O-of course, sir.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]We may have to use Lilina to bargain
with the mercenary knights...[A]
If we use her as a hostage,[A]
they should surrender to us.[A]
But that must be a last resort.[A]
We will fight them ourselves with[A]
the help of Dragon Knights sent
from Bern to crush Ilia's forces!![A]
Devias, I want you to clear out the
town and guard the castle gate.[A]
I will defend the inside of our castle.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir![A]
[9B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Merlinus!
Around how many of Ostia's troops[A]
have joined the rebellion?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Quite a few, I'm afraid.[A]
They have forgotten their
loyalty towards Lord Hector,[A]
and are simply flocking towards the
one with more power, which is Bern.[A]
How disgraceful![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But there is good news too, Master Roy!
There is a band of mercenary knights[A]
from Ilia that are willing to join
forces with us and attack the rebels.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x157]Mercenary knights from Ilia?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
They said that they signed a contract
with Lord Hector that they would fight[A]
Bern alongside Ostia's troops.[A]
[OpenRight]That's fortunate.[A]
But when the mercenary knights hear the
news that Lord Hector has passed away,[A]
that contract would probably be broken.[A]
Do you think it's possible for us to
officially hire them into our service?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would have thought
so too, Master Roy.[A]
However, they already knew
of Lord Hector's death.[A]
They offered to fight
alongside us anyway.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Why do they go that far,
when they are mercenaries?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia is a snowy area with a harsh
temperature so the land isn't very arable.[A]
Therefore, sending out mercenaries[A]
to fight for pay is one of
Ilia's main sources of[A]
economic input.[A]
I've also heard that mercenaries
from Ilia put trust over anything[A]
else and that they never
betray their employers.[A]
The rumors are true, I see.[A]
[9C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It looks like the Lycia Alliance have
started attacking the rebels.[A]
All right, we're going too.[A]
Let's go and drive off
the rebel forces![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Will do, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Wait,
where's Noah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ummm, I think he went to
the arena a while ago.[A]
He said he's coaching a young
girl in the sword arts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That Noah, a coach?
That's unusual...[A]
Well, no matter.[A]
Once he finds out that
we're attacking the rebels,[A]
he'll catch up to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yup.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
let's go.[A]
[9D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.[A]
Well then, Fir, I should
get going soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for coaching
me, Sir Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No problem.
But I must say you surprised me.[A]
You suddenly came up to me
and said, "I want to fight a[A]
match with you!"[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.
It was my first time in[A]
the arena...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you asked another person,
you would have been killed.[A]
You need to look your opponent over
very carefully before choosing to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you must not hesitate to surrender
if it looks like you're going to lose.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Exactly.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]You can always win back your money,
but if you lose your life,[A]
it's all over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What are your plans now?[A]
Are you going to stay here and work
on your sword skills?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I'm planning to travel
to the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Western Isles?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They're building a new mine there,
and I heard that a lot of people[A]
are going there looking for work.[A]
They must be strong people if they're
miners, so I thought it would be the[A]
ideal place to find people to
fight for my training.[A]
And besides...[A][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Besides?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Western Isles is where my
mother first met my father.[A]
She's dead now, but when she was my
age she was also traveling around the[A]
world training her sword skills.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see...
You surprise me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]All you were saying at first was,[A]
"I want to become strong,[A]
I want to become strong", right?[A]
So I thought swordplay was all
you had interest in.[A]
But you were training because you
wanted to be like your mother?[A]
I'm so happy to see that you
do have a cute side![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? ...Sir Noah!
Please don't tease me![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hahahaha![A]
[9E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13C][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The reinforcements should be
arriving from the south soon.[A]
Hehe... That Lycia army'll be shocked
when they get hit from behind![A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...[A]
I was expecting somebody a
little older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake![A]
And Lilina's sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.
Then we'll help you[A]
as much as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come, we must concentrate on
the enemy right now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[A0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're one of the Ilian
mercenaries, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yeah.[A]
And what do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I'm the leader of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh! I heard about you...[A]
From now on, is it all right if
I join with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure
that's alright?[A][.....]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't you have to ask your
commander if it's okay..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He told us to join with
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
That's enough for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he mean like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]This is a battlefield.[.....]
If you take your time to[A]
check everything with your commander,[A]
then you won't be able to act
quickly in trouble.[A]
It's not good to disobey orders,
but outside of that you can[A]
play it by ear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see...
Thanks for telling me.[A]
[A1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][NormalPrint]Noah![OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sir Zealot,[.....]
I'm sorry that I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I heard you were coaching a
young girl in the sword arts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A][.....]
She was a little naive,
so I couldn't help it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Is she not with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She said she was headed
for the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
Pity, I thought she might have
been of some help if she were[A]
still here.
But you, who ordinarily wouldn't[A]
Start nosing around into other
people's matters, a coach?[A]
Now that is unusual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you think so, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Treck and I were joking around saying
that you may have fancied the girl.[A]
But it is in the arena, so
that probably wasn't the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[A2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Treck, we are now going into
the Lycia army's service.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm, not the most enthusiastic[.....]
response. You don't like the idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
No, I have no problem with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, all right.
Just thought I'd ask.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia...
Nah, we shouldn't have much trouble.[A]
[A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're one of the Ilian

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Hmmm?

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, then I'm going to be
under your leadership from now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What??[.....]
Is that okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You don't have to check
with your commander first?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, don't worry about that.[A]
He said we were to join with the
Lycia alliance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he really mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]"Really mean" what?
We're in the middle of a battle.[A]
If you take the time to check every
little thing with your commander,[A]
you'll be dead.[A]
I'm not going against his orders,
though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].. All right.[A]
[A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's Noah.
You were at the arena,[A]
weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
sorry I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Doesn't really matter...
We've just started fighting.[A]
I haven't talked to the Lycia
Alliance army yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Don't worry, I just got done
talking to their leader.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really![A]
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.[A]
Noah, I leave the negotiations
with the Lycia Alliance to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir![A]
[A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck,
what is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just met with the Lycia
Alliance leader.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, did you?
Why didn't you tell me, then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, not like that.
I just met with him now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's fine.[A]
Then it's time for us to submit
to his leadership.[A]
Treck, I leave the negotiations with
the Lycian Alliance to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir![A]
[A6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][FastPrint][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, sir, are you Sir Zealot[.....]
of the Ilia Mercenary Knights?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy. I'm the leader of[.....]
the army that's fighting the rebels.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...
I was expecting somebody a little older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am here, respecting the
will of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a valuable person.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I want to retake Ostia,
for Lord Hector's sake![A]
And Lilina's sake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right. Then we'll
help you as much as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can thank me after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come, we must concentrate on the
enemy right now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
Hey you, look at this great
thing I made.[A]
It fires arrows MUCH further
than a normal bow![A]
It's very useful, right?
Right. Just like I thought.[A]
I'll give it to you guys,
I want it with someone that[A]
knows how to use it.[A]
[A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
[OpenMidRight]This..? This is the Torch Staff![A]
It creates light in the foggiest places![A]
If you're in a fog, you
can't attack or see anything![A]
It helps to have this when
it works against you.[A]
[A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
[OpenMidRight]Medicine! Medicine!
This cures anything![A]
No matter what kind of wounds
you have, this will restore[A]
you completely!
The contents are a secret,[A]
though...
Can't tell you,[A]
or I'll get in trouble.
Hmm?[A]
You don't want the medicine?[A]
Aww, I'll give you some for
free, if you buy it next time![A]
[AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]
[ToggleSmile]This town used to belong to Lycia!
But now, look at it...[A]
You guys are out to restore
Ostia's former glory, right?[A]
Then, take this gem...
If you sell it,[A]
it will catch a high price!
Please, help Ostia![A]
[AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x167]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you going to help Lady Lilina?
Here's something that can cure
injures from a distance![A]
If Lady Lilina's hurt,
please help her...[A]
[AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A while back, some unknown
person was dying in the street.[A]
When I helped him, he gave me
this sword.[A]
Really strange person, but nice...
Hm? Here's the sword.[A]
You can have it!
Just take good care of it.[A]
[AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Be careful. General Leygance
is allied with Bern now![A]
He went and slaughtered all those
who resisted him...[A]
But I saved my own hide.
Please take this, it's proof
for Heroes.[A]
Give this to them, and keep
fighting to protect Ostia...[A]
[AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
Social Knights, Paladins, Nomads...
All those guys riding on horses...[A]
This spear, the Knight Killer,
is effective against them.[A]
There's alot of horsemen in
the rebel army.[A]
So use this against them![A]
[AF]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]You... you beat Bern's
Dragon Knights!?[A][Clear]
Ergh...
I'll not let you pass here![A]

[B0]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]General Leygance...
Please be careful...[A][Clear]
These people are...[......]
strong...[A]
[B1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Okay, the city should be
under control by now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Now we have to recapture
Castle Ostia and rescue Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Master Roy, we are currently breaking
down the gate to enter the castle.[A]
I understand that you want to get in
quickly, but we are working as fast[A]
as we can, so please be patient![A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Speaking of Lady Lilina...[A]
What do you think of Lord
Hector's story, Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You mean about the Dragons?
They weren't myth,[A]
they were real...[A]
Lord Hector is one of the greatest
battle tacticians in Lycia.[A]
And his army was decimated in such
a short time...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Bern's army is among
the strongest in Elibe.[A]
I say, those Dragon Knights are
indeed very formidable opponents.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course the Dragon Knights must
have been tough enemies.[A]
But the real Dragons... I can't even
imagine how powerful they must be.[A]
The weapons that are effective
against Dragons...[A]
I wonder where they are?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume they must be
the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So if we use those weapons, we
can fight the Dragons effectively.[A]
But I wonder what a Divine Weapon
is doing in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps Lady Lilina knows that.
Hmm, I do wish to know as well.[A]
Oh![A]
Master Roy, our men have finished
knocking down the gate.[A]
We can enter now![A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight]All right! Charge!
We will rescue Lilina,[A]
no matter what![A]
[B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]
[MoveMidRight]What?!
The enemy has broken into[A]
the castle?[A]
What the hell was Devias
doing out there?![A]
Were those Knights from Ilia
so strong?[A]
...Or was the Lycia army larger
than I expected...[A]
In any case, they have gotten into
the 'unconquerable' Castle Ostia![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]We must drive them out, or
Bern will look down upon us...[A]
[Clear]
You over there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Yes sir![A]
[OpenMidRight]Set up the troops all over the castle![A]
Especially around the throne room![A]
Prepare your defenses![A]
We must not let the Lycia Army
get any further into the castle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Understood sir![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]One more thing.[A]
I want you to discreetly
kill Lilina during the battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]What? ... Sir, weren't we
supposed to keep her alive?[A]
[OpenRight]I was planning on using her
as a hostage.[A]
But there are still many rebels
that put faith in her.[A]
If we openly use her as a hostage,
those soldiers might turn against us.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]But in that case sir, they would
surely turn on us if we kill her![A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]So I said to do it discreetly,
didn't I?![A]
Kill her quietly, and pretend
that she was hit by a stray arrow.[A][Clear]
Then we can make the enemy
responsible for it![A]
Now go![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, sir...[A]
[B3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][.....]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11D]...General Roy of the Lycia
Alliance Army, I presume.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]! Who are you?[.....]
An enemy?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm on your side.
Greetings, my name is Astol.[A]
I used to work here in the
service of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]Excuse me, but what kind of
work were you doing?[A]
You certainly don't look like
one of Ostia's servants...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My, my, aren't we a
little rude, old man?[A]
See, I'm a spy.[A]
I go on secret missions to gather
information, steal things,[A]
check on people...
That kind of thing.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Hmm, I see.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]If people can tell that I'm working
for a noble just by looking at me,[A]
then I'm not much of a spy, am I?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Anyway, for a month now, I've been
running around Lycia to gather the[A]
latest news.
When I heard about Lord Hector's[A]
death in Araphen, I returned here
as quickly as I could.[A]
Then I see that those idiots,[A]
Leygance and Devias have caused a
rebellion![A]
I didn't make it in time to save
Lord Hector, but I don't want to be[A]
too late for Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenRight]Then you'll join us?
Good, let's work together to[A]
rescue her.
Do you know where Lilina is?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Of course, investigating into
matters like that is my job.[A]
Lady Lilina is locked into a small
room in the center of the castle.[A]
And that dastard Leygance is sitting
on the throne like he owns the place.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to hurry then.
We must defeat the rebels and[A]
rescue Lilina before Narshen
arrives from Bern![A]
[B4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's all this noise?[A]
Is there a battle going on?[A]
I wonder what's happening outside...[A]
[B5]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x116][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth,
this is a dead end![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][CloseSpeechFast]Don't worry.
This wall has cracks in it.[A]
We can break through it if we hit
it a little with our weapons.[A]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x1BD]I wonder where
Lady Lilina is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a pretty good idea
where she is.[A]
We've known this castle for
a long time.[A]
Hmm, I do wonder what's
causing all the noise, though.[A]
[OpenRight]The Alliance Army?
Then my brother must be[A]
with them...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... We don't know if he's
still alive.[A]
You shouldn't have such
high expectations.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Oh... Yes.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Barth, you don't
have to be so cold.[A]
He's Wendy's only brother,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You must never look away
from reality.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]It's all right, Oujay.
Sir Barth is right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As an Armor Knight of Ostia,
you must never panic, no[A]
[.....]matter what the situation.
Understood, Wendy?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]...Yes.[A]
[B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C]Yes!
Just as I thought,
they're at each other again.[A]
I mean, how stupid can these
nobles get?[A]
I can never understand what the
fun is in fighting all the time.[A]
Oh well,
guess I'll swipe what I can.[A]
[B7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][NormalPrint]Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122]...Roy?[.....]
Is it really you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You came!
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank goodness you're all right.
Here, take this spell book.[A]
Use it to defend yourself for
the time being.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thanks.[A]
[B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][NormalPrint]Bors![.....]
You're all right![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][FastPrint]Why, is it Wendy?
I'm glad to see you're okay too.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...!?
What the...[A]
What are you wearing?!
Did you apply to become an Ostian[A]
Armor Knight or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Actually, I did.
I was knighted just yesterday.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What are you doing...
I thought I told you to leave the[A]
fighting to us and live your life
as you wished![A]
You didn't need to become an
Armor Knight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I thought about it, and
what I truly want is to become a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't want to just wait here
for you to return from battle.[A]
I want to become a knight
as great as you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well, you were always stubborn,
weren't you, Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You should live your life as you wish.
If Mother and Father were alive,[A]
they would say that as well.
But the way of the knight is no[A]
easy feat![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm prepared![.....]
I shall never give up![A]
[B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
Lady Lilina!
You are safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors, I am
sorry that[A]
I worried you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, my Lady!
You were alive...[A]
That in itself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors.[A]
And you kept your promise
that you would
protect Roy for me.[A]
I knew I was doing[A]
the right thing
when I asked you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, my Lady![A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barth, you were right.
Leygance was planning a rebellion.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]If I had believed you in the first
place, this wouldn't have happened...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
Lady Lilina, you do not have
anything to apologize about.[A]
The one to be prosecuted is
Leygance, who insulted your kind[A]
and trusting heart toward him.
[ToggleSmile]It is your kindness that[A]
we respect the most, my Lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Barth...[A]
[BB]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]You vermin of the

How can you fight[A]

so hard...?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]We've finally recaptured

[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Roy.[A]
I'm glad that my father didn't have
to go through the trouble.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, is my father still in Araphen?[A]
I heard it was a tough battle there,
but does it looks like it's going to[A]
take much longer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...
Haven't you heard anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector...
has passed away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry... When we arrived
at Castle Araphen...[A]
It was already under Bern's control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not your fault...
Don't apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Hector was already severely
wounded when we arrived.[A]
If only we had gotten there faster,
maybe I could have helped him...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No... it's okay.
I... was prepared for this...[A]
I'm a warrior's daughter.[A]
I've been taught not to panic
in times like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So everyone should have told me...
They're too considerate...[A]
I'm strong too, you know...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina, you don't have to
hold back in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's okay...
I'll be with you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Master Roy! Bern's Dragon Knights

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hehehe...
[ToggleMouthMove]Are you Roy?[A]
I must thank you for getting
rid of that idiot Leygance for me.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Now, you will leave Ostia
to me.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous!
Who would give Ostia to the likes[A]
of you..![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
Then do you wish to fight us

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]I shall annihilate you,

A legion has arrived from Etruria![A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]I can see that, you fool!
Why...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][FastPrint]I am Percival,
Knight General of Etruria.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Yesterday, Sorcery General Cecilia
informed me that Ostia had[A]
requested Etruria's protection.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You seem discontent.
We are prepared for battle.[A]
But can those Dragon Knights of yours
stand a chance against all of us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Cecilia,
Sorcery General of Etruria![A]
Ostia is now under our
protection.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Argh...
You...you...!!![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][CloseSpeechFast]General Narshen,
please control your temper![A]
General Percival is one of the
strongest warriors in Etruria![A]
And with General Cecilia here as well
we'll be slaughtered![A]
[OpenLeft]I know!
We're leaving![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]Cecilia, is it?
Watch your back from now on![A]
[C1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you General Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
I am in charge of the Alliance Army
in the place of Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
Lycia is in a time of hardship.[A]
Our king also sends his words of
regret for Lord Hector's death.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for your consideration.[A]
If Etruria hadn't helped us...
Ostia would be under Bern's control now.[A]
Thank you very much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am not the one to thank.
I simply followed my king's orders.[A]
You should thank Cecilia, who
went against the king to help you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]She...
disobeyed the king's orders?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
now isn't that something?[A]
Well, I must be off.[A]
Two of the three Etrurian Generals
shouldn't be leaving the country[A]
for so long.[A]
Cecilia,[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134]
[OpenMidLeft]can you take care of the rest?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Thank you, Percival.[A]
You can leave the rest to me.[A]
[C2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Whew...
General Percival...[A]
Now he's someone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][ToggleSmile]Nervous, were you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How are you doing, Roy?
You look a little tired,[A]
but you seem okay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thanks to Etruria,
we were able to avoid disaster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad we made it
here in time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A]
I put you through a lot of
trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
It's going to be beneficial for Etruria
for Ostia to go under our protection.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Beneficial?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Bern's been acting aggressively
these days, as you know.[A]
We also want to do something about it,
but since we haven't been directly[A]
invaded, we have no reason to go to[A]
war with them.[A]
But if Bern gets any stronger, the
balance of powers would be shattered.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So when Ostia requested[A]
protection, you saw it as a good
reason to declare war on Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We just did what would be
best for us.[A]
You don't need to feel that
you're in our debt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you shouldn't thank us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Understood. I won't.[A]
Well anyway, please come in and
meet the rest of our army.[A]
[C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134]... He's gotten so bold in the short

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yup. We just saw 'em arrive on

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just as that other group said...[A]
All right, they're probably
floundering around in the fog[A]
unable to see anything.
Just sneak up on them[A]
from behind and kill 'em off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss.[A]

I couldn't be of help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry about it.
It isn't your responsibility,[A]
Lady Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. But even within Etruria,
there are a lot of people voicing their[A]
discontent on how the advisor is
treating Lycia like servants.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Advisor? I thought the
king had made the decision to send Lycia[A]
to clear out the bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. Advisor Roartz had been working with[A]
Lord Arcard, who's in charge
of the mining operation in the[A]
Western Isles, and they decided to
do it on their own without[A]
consulting the king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How can they do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you remember last year's
tragedy in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.
Etruria's next heir,[A]
Prince Mildain,
suddenly passed away last year.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had the honor to meet him.[A]
I understand that he was a very
bright individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... If the prince were alive,
Etruria wouldn't be like this.[A]
King Mordred couldn't bear the fact
that his son had died.[A]
The shock was so great that he never
completely recovered from it.[A]
And today, it seems like he's always
in a different world, and he doesn't[A]
really pay attention to anything going
on around him or in his country.[A]
Roartz took advantage of this.[A][Clear]
Now, he's basically in charge
of what goes in the palace.[A]
Ever since then, he has kept the
Three Etrurian Generals,[A]
Lord Douglas, Percival, and me,
away from the king unless there's[A]
a great emergency.[A]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Fir.
Sorry I had to call you in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What is all this noise about?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well you see, some brigands
are attacking this island.[A]
The people living here are in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]What![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I sent some guys over to try and stop
them, but the invaders are pretty tough.[A]
The situation doesn't look good.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]I can't believe...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If only I could go out there...
but I can't leave the castle.[A]
So, Fir, I'm sorry,
but...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. I shall go

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave it to me!
Attacking innocent villagers...[A]
that's not forgivable![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I asked another guy too,
so you can work with him.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Someone else?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yeah, a nomad named Shin.[.....]
He looks frail, but he's got[A]
a decent shot with his bow.[A]
[CC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151][ToggleSmile]Boss, you sure? I mean,
letting a girl like that fight[A]
out there...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
Once she's killed, we can[A]
get that sword she's carrying.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sword?
That weird one she has?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's no ordinary sword.
That's the 'Wo Dao', a famous katana.[A]
If we can get it from her and sell it,
it'll be worth a fortune. Hehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
[CloseSpeechFast]So that's why you were so[A]
generous to her at first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't make a move up until
now, but now's a chance.[A]
Listen, I want you to follow her.
When you see the chance, grab[A]
the sword from her![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss![A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Um, did you also [ToggleSmile]join the fight
to protect the people living here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I have no such
interest in such things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm paid to fight.[.....]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...I gotta keep the

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... you're from Sacae,

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What took you all
the way out here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It's nothing new. You look like
you're from Sacae, and you're also here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well I'm traveling around Elibe
to train myself, and...[A]
Oh, you weren't asking about me,
were you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...Whew.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I'm looking for somebody.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Who?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...My clan lost to Bern
when they invaded Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Our clan leader let me escape,
and he told me[A]
to find and protect
his granddaughter.[A]
So I left the battlefield
to fulfill his request.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
Well, I hope you find her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]

What are you doing here?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, I joined this army
a while back... Whoa![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][ToggleSmile]What are you thinking?!
Put away your sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Noah! I thought you were
nobler than this![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just because you're
a mercenary knight...[A]
Lending your services to pirates?!
You should be ashamed![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't play dumb!
You're working with a band of[A]
pirates to attack the people
living on this island![A]
And you call yourself a knight?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um, can I have a sec? I think
there's a really big misunderstanding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misunderstanding?!
You still insist...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We're trying to help
the villagers.[A]
We're supposed to go defeat
the head of a pirate group.[A]
I think his name was Scott
or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Scott is the head
of a pirate band?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you think I'm lying, why don't
you ask the pirate over there?[A]
He's right behind you,
hiding in the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pirate?
What pirate...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151]

Wait![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You didn't suspect at
all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Scott was very
kind to me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really? Rumors say that
he's a very cruel man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, my mother used to say that you
shouldn't judge people by their looks...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, that's true,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I was lending my services
to pirates...[A]
What can I do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then you want to come
along with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?
Would it be okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We're always looking for more
people to strengthen our army.[A]
I'll talk to Roy about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you![A]

What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]For me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
That was the clan leader's orders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...What happened to
our clan after I left?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, we didn't stand
a chance against Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...We lost.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What has happened to
my grandfather?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He is continuing the
struggle against Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I was told by the clan leader
to leave and look for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then will you fight
alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]With you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We will be helping Grandfather because
this army is fighting against Bern.[A]
Also, this army saved my life
earlier.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Understood, my lady.
If that is your plan,[A]
then I am at your disposal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[D0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x187]
[ToggleSmile] This area basically belongs
to the pirates.[A]
They just steal from us
all the time.[A]
Resistance?
That's useless.[A]
They can do whatever they want
because they have lots of support.[A]
We can't fight against
them like the resistance force.[A]
[D1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18A]
[Clear]You saved us![A]
Are you with the Registrants?
No?[A]
Then you're just normal good people?
Just as you've seen, this island[A]
is swarmed with pirates and bandits![A]
But... what are we going to do?[A]
Rumors around here say there's a severe
battle going on in the west.[A]
Go ahead and tell them that
we're leaving the island...[A]
[D2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x185]
[ToggleSmile]Eh...[A]
The only people here are the
women and children.[A]
Everyone else, the workers,
have gone north to the mines.[A]
They aren't even allowed to sleep there,
they just work until they die...[A]
My brother, who escaped,
is as thin as an old man.[A]
That day, he drew his last breath.[A]
Now that I've told you this...
Can you do... er, sorry...[A]
I've said too much.
Please forget all of this.[A]
We're leaving this island now.[A]
[D3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C]
Geez, there's so much mist here...[A]
In these conditions, you have NO idea,
if anyone is lurking around![A]
The Torch Staff is useful, even for
those hard-eyed thieves.[A]
[D4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
The resistance is doing quite well.[A]
In the north, and in the east--
they're always in the thick[A]
of battle.
Which way will you go?[A]
[D5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x186]
Among the pirates is a very
skilled nomad...[A]
Even though you can't see him
at all in the mist...[A]
They're horse-riding people,
but this guy also has a girl[A]
with him...[A]
[D6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
The nearby villages...
Everyone in them are leaving[A]
the islands.
It's very sad, really.[A]
If you want to visit, you'd
better do it quickly.[A]
You don't have time to go to both,
so you'll have to decide.[A]
[D7]
[LoadFace][0x13E][ToggleSmile]So the fog didn't
[ToggleSmile]stop you after all...[A]
But you gotta be pretty[A]
beat up by now!
I'll finish you off![A]
[D8]
[LoadFace][0x13E][ToggleSmile]Who the hell...
are you?[A]
You're no ordinary army..[A]
[D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, it looked like the
enemy was trying to ambush us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They must have known
we were coming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Something must be going on
behind the scenes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. Clearing out the bandits
might be harder than we had[A]
expected.
Ever since Bern started[A]
their invasion, something is
different with Elibe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wonder what's going to 
happen from now...[A]
Dragons reappearing, Bern's sudden
invasion, the collapse of[A]
the Lycia Alliance...[A]
All of these strange things
happening at once.[A]
Still, we have to take things one
at a time however tedious it[A]
may seem.[A]

[DA]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...
What do we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]How about moving north
along the coast?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]North...
Towards the mines?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right. I've heard that the people
living on the islands are being[A]
forced into labor over there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So we must
rescue them first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Then we might be able to
find out who's behind all this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must start
somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right...
Let's head north.[A]

[DB]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now... where do we go
from here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's head west.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]West?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've heard there's a rebel
group based there.[A]
They're fighting the bandits
to protect the villagers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. So we can visit them and
gather some information on what's[A]
going on these islands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right. If we just go searching
blindly, we won't get anywhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have no objections,
Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
then let's head west.[A]

[DC]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Now... where do we go from here?
We must choose.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do you have an idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If we follow the coast up
north, we should reach the[A]
largest mine on the isles.
Perhaps the bandits gather there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our task is to get rid of
all of the bandits.[A]
We shouldn't be wandering
around aimlessly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You're right.
Let's head north![A]
[DD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1E4][ToggleSmile]How is that spy from the
resistance force doing?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Do you mean that dancer called
Lalum, or something?[A]
We threw her in the
dungeon, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well,
did she admit anything?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, she just keeps repeating that
it is some kind of mistake and[A]
that she has nothing to do with
the resistance force.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, she thinks she can get
away with that, does she?[A]
I should go ask
her myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Nord![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is a messenger here
sent by the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Ah, it's the army that was sent to
clean up the bandits on these isles..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It seems that they want permission
to pass through to Mt. Ebrakhm.[A]
[OpenRight]...Lord Arcard did say to get rid
[ToggleSmile]of the Lycia Alliance Army while[A]
they were still here... Hehehe...
This is a great chance to show off[A]
to Lord Arcard and get a share
of his riches.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Send out some troops
and kill them off![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir..[A][Clear]
What about the messenger?[A]
[OpenRight]Kill him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understood sir.[A]
[OpenRight]Also, don't forget to bring
out the ballistae.[A]
Those are some nice weapons that
can attack from afar, so use[A]
them to confuse the Alliance army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes sir.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]And make sure the enemy
doesn't get ahold of them![A]
[DE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Are there some

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, they seem

[OpenMidRight]... What about the messenger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He hasn't returned yet...
That means...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?[A]
Why is Nord attacking us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The enemy is advancing...
Master Roy, what should we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I guess we'll have to fight.[A]
Anyway, we need to get to the castle.
Then we might learn something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
I suppose so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, we're going

But don't kill more than
you have to![A]

Where's Gonzales?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][FastPrint]Here... I here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]There's a village to the north,
right along the mountain.[A]
You understand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That might be a hidden base for
the resistance forces.[A]
I want you to go there and
destroy it, village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Right. Now go![A]
A stupid brute like you only
comes in use at times like this.[A]
Now get moving.[A]

I gotta avenge them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those guys that always
were with you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah... When I wasn't around, they
were taken to the mines, and told[A]
that they would be given work.[A]
But they worked like slaves
until they...died.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Maybe they weren't that smart,
but they were good guys...[A]
And somebody just killed them off...
just like that...!![A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're going to
avenge them on your own?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is there something wrong
with that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
But you're not going back[A]
to being a sea merchant?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
Once I avenge my friends[A]
and once the war resides,
I'll think about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]... We won't forget you.

[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[A]

you're going up against the[A]
castle's soldiers on your own.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm Roy, leader of the Lycia
Alliance Army.[A]
We're here due to a
request from Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're with Etruria?!
Then you're not on my side.[A]
Die![A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, wait!
We're also fighting the[A]
castle's troops.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't know either.
We were sent here by Etruria to[A]
rid the islands of the bandits,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You said that you're fighting
the castle's troops.[A]
Then you wanna hire me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm a pirate, so I'm pretty familiar
with the lands around here.[A]
You look like you've never been
here before, so you could use a[A]
guide, couldn't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That would help,
but why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to help you with
your mission.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I'm a pirate, so I'm
probably part of the "bandits"[A]
that you're talking about, but
I generally only go after rich[A]
people who have more than they
need anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right,
then I'll ask you to help us.[A]
We don't know this area very well,
so we were having trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Great!
Leave it to me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... This is it, guys.
I'll avenge you with all of[A]
my strength![A]
After that, I guess I can tag
along with that Roy guy...[A]
[E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x184]
[ToggleSmile]I'm worried --
Is Lalum all right?[A]
For our sake she brought us weapons
from all over the place.[A]
Even when we begged her to hide,
she still continued to help us.[A][Clear]
Here's an axe that she brought us.
It's a pretty strange one...[A]
It's strong against swords,
but weak against spears![A]
But instead of this, I'd
rather see her dance again...[A]
[E7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x188]
[ToggleSmile]The bandits and pirates...[A]
You know, when they're born,
they're so cute.[A]
Maybe if I spoke to them,
I'd have an understanding.[A]
[E8]
[LoadFace][0x1E4]So you made it here.[A][Clear]
I shall take your
lives...[A]
[E9]
[LoadFace][0x1E4][ToggleSmile]...Death?[A][Clear]
I feel... my life..
draining.. away...[A]
[EA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
We couldn't find out why Nord
attacked us in the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But now there's no mistake
that there's somebody after us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, I think we should contact
Etruria about this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. I'll talk to
General Cecilia about this.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152]Excuse me, Master Roy.[A]
There's a girl whom we found
captured in the dungeon.[A]
She wishes to speak with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To me?
Let her pass.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]You are Master Roy?
The one who's here to clear[A]
out the bandits?[SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][SendToBack][CloseSpeechFast]Roy, please!
Please rescue my friends![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Wow![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][MoveLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hey!
Get off of him![A]
[OpenFarRight]A-Anyway let's calm down
and talk.[A]
Your friends are in danger?[A][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]My name is Lalum.[A]
I'm part of the resistance forces
on this island.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]The one that fights the bandits
and protects the people living here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[.....]
...No![A]
[OpenFarRight]No?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course that's part of our job,
but our real enemy is Etruria![A]
They are working with the bandits
to take more money and resources[A]
from people![A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What!
Is that true!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The marquesses and warlords living here
are taking people into the mine [A]
and work them until they die!![A]
They never let them rest,
even if they're sick or injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Horrible...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]So we're fighting the Etrurian
government to protest against them![A]
Our next plan was to attack the mine
at Mt. Ebrakhm and rescue the[A]
people there![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What's the matter!
Calm down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A villager here leaked the
information on our plan![A]
He was probably tortured,
but I didn't think he would[A]
tell...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]I have to go to the mines
before everyone's captured![SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, then let's go![A]
We have to rescue the resistance forces
and people being forced into labor![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Really!?
Thank you, Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
M-Miss Lalum![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][MoveLeft]Hey!
I said get off of him![A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here, Roy.
Use this sword.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It belongs to our leader, Echidna.
Because you're helping us,[A]
I don't think she'll get mad[A]
even if you use it.[A]
It's called the "Dragon Killer", but
there aren't any Dragons anymore.[A]
Maybe they're useful against
Dragon Knights?[A]
Well I don't really know.[.....]
But it should come to be[A]
handy sometime.[A]
[EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]So Princess Guinevere is nowhere
on the Western Isles?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We searched all over these islands,[A]
and we sent spies in to the
Lycia Alliance Army, but we could[A]
not find the princess anywhere.
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.
I suppose I will search elsewhere.[A]
Bishop Oro, I thank you for your
cooperation with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I will pray that you will be able
to meet with Princess Guinevere soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][ClearFace]
[EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x140]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Bishop Oro,
who was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]A Dragon Knight from Bern.
Her name is Miledy.[A]
She was looking for Princess
Guinevere, who is her mistress.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you tell her where
the princess is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
Princess Guinevere is a valuable hostage.[A]
When Advisor Roartz heard news that
Cecilia was hiding with Guinevere in[A]
Aquleia, he was as excited as the
time when he was reported the[A]
assassination of Prince Mildain
had been successful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bishop Oro!
You mustn't say he[A]
was assassinated...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I must watch my tongue.
Anyway, Guinevere has much value.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And now,
why did you come before me?[A]
Did you not have something
to say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my lord.[A]
It is about the village where
the resistance leader is hiding.[A]
We are now prepared to launch an
attack on the village, so I came[A]
to report.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, well done.[A]
Then start your attack immediately,
before we have any unwanted[A]
interruptions..[A]
[ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So the resistance hideout is in
one of these villages here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
But it's possible that the landlord's
troops have attacked it already.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]I must say, that Oro is a
despicable man.[A]
A bishop should be preaching
the words of God to help the[A]
people.
But in fact he is torturing[A]
his people!
That is far from forgivable![A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]We should probably wait for
General Cecilia's reply, but...[A][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy![A]
Troops from the castle are
attacking the villages![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]What!
Master Roy, should we attack?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]I guess we can't wait for her
reply then... But I want to[A]
help the people here.[A]
Even if it means that we'll be on
bad terms with Etruria...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126]Roy..[A]
[OpenRight]Let's fight!![A]
So we can be proud of our actions
when we return to Lycia![A]
[EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x136]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Miledy, did you find out
where Princess Guinevere is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
It looks like she left the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Just when I thought I had
found her...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So it's no use looking,
then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Gale...
I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the
case on Princess Guinevere in[A]
secrecy, so he only assigned
my group to look for her.[A]
I'm sorry I got you mixed
up into this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're one of the captains working
directly under General Murdock.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Murdock has agreed to
my helping you out.[A]
Anyway, Princess Guinevere must
still be on the mainland.[A]
Well then, I guess we'll ask
General Narshen for some more[A]
help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You're going to bow to
General Narshen?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Hm?
Of course.[A]
He's one of the Three Dragon Lords,
and he's in charge of the armies[A]
attacking Lycia and Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Gale,
aren't you... mad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I mean...[A]
Skill wise, you should be one of
the Three Dragon Lords.[A]
But Narshen accused you of not being
a native of Bern, and he snatched[A]
the position away from you.[A]
And you're going to bow down to
him and ask him for help?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well, what he said was true...
I wasn't born in Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm happy with the position I
have now.[A]
And King Zephiel and General
Murdock put trust in me, even[A]
if I'm not a native of Bern.
What more could I ask?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Gale...[A]
[EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]Echidna!
We have surrounded this entire area![A]
We know you are hiding in there![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x133][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleMouthMove]You are Echidna,

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x189][CloseSpeechFast]Miss Echidna, I'm sorry!
They took my family hostage...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.
Leave this to me.[A]
Hurry home to your family now.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Sorry...
Really.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][CloseSpeechFast]If you surrender peacefully,
perhaps Bishop Oro will have[A]
mercy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sorry, but I'm sorta
the stubborn type.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll resist?
Then we have no choice![A][Clear]
Kill her![A]
[F1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x140]Hahaha...
I've got an idea... Somebody![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lord?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell the bandits that the
villages are in a confused state.[A]
I want them to ransack the villages
and collect all the money and[A]
treasure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes.
But.. are you sure?[A]
If this becomes public...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You forget I speak for God himself.[A]
If anyone tries to accuse me
it would be going against God![A]
Therefore, no one on this island
can prosecute me![A]
Anyway, hurry. It won't be any use
if the crisis in the villages[A]
slow down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[F2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151]So you're sure we can raid the
villages as much as we want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]Yes.
But in return...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah yeah, we're supposed to take
half the loot to the castle, right?[A]
That's one hell of a Bishop you
guys got there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thank you for your
cooperation.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]All right, boys!
Loot the villages![A]
Grab all the treasure![A]
[F3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, bandits are approaching
from the mountains to the east.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They're thinking of attacking the
villages during the confusion...[A]
We have to stop them and rescue
the people![A]
[F4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is taking so long?![A]
Are the resistance forces
that much of a problem?![A]
[OpenMidRight]The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
They are supporting the
resistance force...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What![A]
The Lycia Alliance would turn
against Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have just received a message
from the capital of Djuto![A]
It says...[A]
"The Lycia Alliance Army is responsible
for the murder of Marquess Nord.[A]
They are suspected for turning
against Etruria.[A]
There is also the possibility they
are tied in with the bandits.[A]
Capture them, or kill them if
necessary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So they killed Marquess Nord...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Anyway, they've come up with a
good excuse to get rid of the[A]
Lycia Alliance Army.
Hahaha... tied in with the[A]
bandits, eh?
How ironic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcard has provided some
reinforcements to help us capture[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.
They should be here shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How generous!
He said 'capture them', but he
probably plans on killing them[A]
anyway.[A]
So let's do the job for him.
Kill them all![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, my lord![A]
[F5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]Bishop Oro,
additional reinforcements will[A]
be arriving shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...
I hope this will be enough.[A]
They are fighting better

Good.. If something happened to
you, I wouldn't know what to[A]
say to Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry... If I hadn't been
caught, I could have told you earlier..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's okay.
Don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't cry over spilled milk.
That's not like you.[A]
And besides,
I'm all in one piece.[A]
That's good news, no?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]... Yeah.[A]
So anyway, who's the army
attacking the castle right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army!
They came here to defeat the[A]
bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia, eh?
They've sure come a far
way to get here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And does it look like
they'll help us out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes!
They helped me too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]All right,
then I guess I'll join too![A]
That's okay, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?

Pleased to meet you,[A]

I am a member of the

[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My thanks for saving
our village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, we simply did what
we thought was right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.[A]
Certainly you had thought of
that before you took action?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so,
we did what we felt was right.[A]
Although what we did was a sign
of rebellion against Etruria,[A]
if the truth about these islands
is made public, they will understand.[A]
I have sent a letter to a trustworthy
member of the Etrurian nobility.[A]
If she takes the appropriate
measures, I'm sure we can tip[A]
the tables in our favor.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not be so
sure of that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Did you ever think it strange
Etruria sent you in to get[A]
rid of bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...
Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There is merely my theory..
But I believe the ones who [A]
requested your help, are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... How do you know that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Why did those two have to get
your army off of the mainland?[A]
Could there be some kind of problem
if you stayed in Lycia?[A]

They are approaching here to
take my head![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, them.[A]
They are somewhat of a nuisance
to us of Bern...[A]
We figured it would get difficult
if they became friendly with Etruria,[A]
so we had you send them here...[A]
Well... they fight better
than I would have expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you saying!
Do you know how much I have[A]
lost because of them?
All the riches that I've earned[A]
from these islands... N-No!
Before that, my life![A]
My life is in danger![A]
If they reach here,
I am done for![A]
What must I do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you are that worried,
you should leave this capital[A]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Warfare is what Bern is best at.
And besides, we have our secret[A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]A human?
Turning into a dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can say nothing at this point.
We must proceed with caution.[A]
[0107]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...
[ToggleSmile]Once we take it down,[A]
we can go home.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12B][ToggleSmile]I have sent someone in
already to unlock the gate...[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x126]
[OpenFarRight]Oh,

[OpenRight]The one over there
dressed like a dancer?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Yes.[A][SendToBack]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty?[A]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty!
You're late.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Lalum,
who is 'Your Majesty'?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]?...Oh!
Ah...er...[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]You know,
you look so much[A]

[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]My apologies,
Master Roy.[A]
This is Lalum,
a member of the resistance.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're Roy?[A]
Everyone on these islands has
heard of you![A]
They call you the
'Savior from the East'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Nice to meet you,
I'm Lalum.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Please leave a little distance![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, your face is all red.
How cute~~~!!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]...Lalum...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Oh! R-Right...
I've been hearing strange rumors.[A]
The people here say that a 'human
not human' resides in this castle.[A]
[OpenRight]A human not human...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
They say he changes form into a
creature nobody has ever seen before.[A]
say it looked like one of the
legendary Dragons![A]
[OpenRight]A human?
Turning into a Dragon!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know...
but maybe.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]We must
proceed with caution.[A][SendToBack]
[0108]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x141][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F]Ah, there you are,
Aine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I heard you called...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will go report about the Lycia
Alliance Army to General Narshen.[A]
I want you to defend this castle
while I am away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]... Understood.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Hm?
Who's there![A][Clear][......]
[ToggleMouthMove]...... Just the wind...[A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well then, I shall be going.
I leave the rest to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Haha... The Lycia Alliance
won't stand a chance against[A]
this Dragon.[A]
They won't even be able to
scratch it with normal weapons.[A]
These mamkutes...
They certainly are terrible beasts.[A]
[0109]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125]...So that's what the
'human not human' is.[A]
So it is true that Bern has
brought back the Dragons[A]
into this world.[A]
... So what can I do now...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I'll act like one
of the soldiers and[A]
observe the Dragons power.[A]
[010A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]All the way down here
in the isles in the west,[A]
people working to death for
the nobles in their nest![A]
Well, if that's true, this castle
must be loaded with treasure![A]
The loot wasn't earned rightfully
by the nobles anyway, so I guess[A]
I'll grab it all for myself![A]
[010B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x141][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]The reinforcements from the
south will arrive shortly![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......T-that's all,
Sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]That guy
scares me...[A]
[010C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]
Did you take care of
the cave on the outskirts?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1DB]
Yes, sir.[A]
We hired the bandits
to block the entrance.[A]
No one will be able to
get the Divine Weapon now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Great![A]
Now all we have to do is get
rid of the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[010D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Ray? Ray!
It's good to see you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad that you
look okay.[A]
We were worried.
You just left one day,[A]
saying that you were 'going on a
journey to train your magic skills'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be able to
effectively learn magic sitting[A]
in that orphanage.[A]
It was a miracle that I
could learn what I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ray...
The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]?
What happened?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bern's forces came...
and burned it down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... What happened to everybody?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father was killed
protecting us...[A]
The little children are under the
protection of the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I see.[A]
Good...they'll be happier
living with the church[A]
instead of an old orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to say
it that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Ray!
Come with us.[A]
Let's defeat Bern and
pick up the little ones![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't find
interest in such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Still... the Lycia Alliance Army
might not be a bad place to be.[A]
They seem to have some kind of
connection with the Dragons.[A]
So if you insist,
I suppose I can go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ray...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I hope you understand![A]
I'm not joining to avenge Father
or the orphanage or anything![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes!

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So don't look

[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly.
What are you doing here?[A]
What happened to the
orphanage?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]... So you are concerned, even
though you just ran off like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I was never concerned.
You just reminded me of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]... The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Bern's troops burned it to the
ground when they invaded Lycia.[A]
Father...
He was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What!?
They killed Father...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Father.
I know we're stuck on these islands[A]

[OpenMidRight]Well, I suppose there's no

[OpenMidLeft]... I'll go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?!

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern seems to be tied in

I'm curious about them.[A]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That was close...[A]
The power of a Dragon... amazing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]A human not human...
This is what it meant.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How many more of these
does Bern have...?[A]
[......]How are we supposed to put up a
fight against monsters like this!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
Please calm yourself.[A]
[OpenRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand your worries.[A]
But if you start to panic, everyone
in this army will start to get[A]
anxious.
Please understand that.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is a perfectly understandable
reaction after fighting something[A]
like that.[A]
But now... we know something
that we did not before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you not remember?[A]
I told you of the rumor
that Arcard was tied in[A]
with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
If there are Bern's Dragons in
the Etrurian capital...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So Arcard was indeed
taking contract with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That means Lycia is in danger...[A]
We must return to the mainland.
We have to contact General Cecilia[A]
and think of a plan...[A]

[0114]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, before returning[A]
to the mainland, we still
have things to do on these isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are there still more enemies?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
One of the Divine Weapons[A]
is hidden in a cave near here.[A]
If we can obtain it,
fighting the Dragons will[A]
become a little easier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Divine Weapon... Exactly!
If we can get all eight of them,[A]
we have a chance of defeating Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... we must obtain[A]
as many as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go
to the cave you speak of![A]
[0115]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Report![A]
I have a message from Etruria...[A]
A rebellion has broken out at the
Etrurian Castle City of Aquleia.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]What![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The rebel leaders are
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
They have captured King Mordred,
and they are announcing their plan[A]
to divide ownership of the world
between Bern and Etruria![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]No... the two strongest nations
in Elibe joining forces...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Is General Cecilia all right!?
And how about Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We do not have accurate
information...[A]
But it seems like the Three
Etrurian Generals have split up.[A]
Sorcery General Cecilia has escaped
from Aquleia and is headed[A]
for the Island of Misul
in the west.[A]
[OpenRight]What about the other Generals?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]They have been forced to join
the rebels because King Mordred[A]
was taken hostage.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Master Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We need to contact
General Cecilia...[A]
Princess Guinevere...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Y-Your Majesty!?

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just now.[A]
The general from Etruria fights well,
I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes... But we shall have everything
under control very soon.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, let me.
I will fight her myself.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][FastPrint]Your Highness, there is

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No matter.
It shall be some good exercise.[A][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142]

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I suppose this is all one could
expect from an Etrurian General.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty.[A]
If you would allow it,
can you leave her to me?[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have some certain... bad memories

I want to punish her for them.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, all right.

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Your Majesty.[......]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]Bern is attacking the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...This isn't what they said.[A]
They had decided to leave the Etrurian
matters to us Etrurians.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What shall we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was it General Narshen who made
the order to attack the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, sir.
It was King Zephiel himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
The king did it himself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]So it looks like Bern had
no intention of leaving anything to[A]
us in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]We are going to move right now.
Tell the rest of them that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight]Well, if there's still a possibility
that she's alive, then I won't[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Zephiel, why?[A]
Why do you cause a war, killing[A]
innocent people...[A]
[OpenRight]Innocent, you say?
Hmph, jealousy, vanity, greed...[A]
People are fighting over these silly
things in every nation.[A]
And you say they are innocent?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Well...[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]The world must be liberated
from such pointless things that[A]
men fight over.
That is the purpose of this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But... people are being
brutally killed in the process.[A]
[OpenRight]Sacrifice is always needed
in a radical change.[A]
That is nothing new.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Zephiel...![A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Guinevere, you are my only sister.[A]
Therefore,
I will forgive you this time.[A]
But not the next.
Do you understand?[A]

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narshen![A]
The leader of Guinevere's defenders
is here, no?[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x142]Yes.
Her name is Miledy.[A]
[OpenRight]All right.[A]
Tell her to take Guinevere
back to Bern.[A]
Also tell her to make sure that
the Fire Emblem is returned to[A]

[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Miledy, please!

[CloseSpeechFast]...Should I oblige,
what would you do next?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I understand that Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army is near here...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]!?[.....]
You would join the Enemy!?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]If we do nothing, the world will
be overrun by Bern's forces...[A]
No matter what kind of reasoning he
gives, what he is doing is the same.[A]
He is forcing others into submission
through power.[A]
And I do not think that will lead
to anything good...[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Miledy,
I ask you to let me go.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]...There is one thing.[A]
[OpenFarRight]?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is one thing I cannot
forgive you for, Your Highness.[A]
When you left Bern earlier, why did
you not come and ask for my opinion...?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Well... I thought your
reputation would be damaged.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Did you think I would
prioritize my reputation above you?[A]
I am your loyal Knight more
than I am a Knight of Bern.[A]
That has not changed since
I was knighted.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Miledy...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So if you told me to let you go, then I

[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narshen.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142]
[OpenRight]I will give you some Dragons to

I want you to send some

[OpenMidLeft]The Nabata Desert?[A]
The desert lands located in the

[OpenRight]Right.[A]
I heard that there is a hidden
village there where Dragons have been[A]
staying since the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... then there is a high chance
that a Divine Weapon is located there.[A]
[OpenRight]Exactly.[A]
They must not fall into the hands
of the enemy.[A]
I already sent some
troops to start attacking,[A]
but they are outnumbered.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Your Majesty.[A]
I shall have the village
taken in no time.[A]

Maybe I didn't do a good job...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes, you did.
Thank you.[A]
We must find a way out

...Ow...![A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Don't move...
The wound will open again.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]But I must do something...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It will be all right.[A]
I can see a light... that

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.
That light will aid us both...[A]
We must wait for it...[A]

It's them![A]
The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?

I thought you had taken care
of them at Djuto![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did![A]
Well... I left a Dragon to
deal with them, so...[A]
I never thought they would
have survived![A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
In that case, my reputation as your
Commanding Officer is also jeopardized![A]
If I can't defeat the
Lycia Alliance Army here, people[A]

I must do something...
But they defeated a Dragon...[A]
They seem to be tougher
Than I expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Narshen...
What should we do...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have no choice...
Flaer.[A]
I will return to Aquleia and
plan an attack on the[A]
Lycia Alliance Army.
Flaer, you stay here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][FastPrint]!
M-Me... Stay here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to defeat them.[A]
I just want you to hit them as

their numbers.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]General Narshen!
You would use me as cannon fodder![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Flaer...[A]
To tell you the truth, you would
have been executed a long time[A]

You should be thankful.
Hehehe...[A]

[ToggleSmile]Yes, what is it,
General Percival?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We're leaving.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's actions are clearly an act of
insult to us of Etruria.[A]
I cannot aid Bern any further
We must return to Aquleia and[A]
inform Lord Douglas of this

Retreat at once![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]

I got it to defend myself because
I heard an army was approaching,[A]

We tried to stay an

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They attacked you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
I... was too slow,
and I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see... but why would Bern
attack a small village like yours?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I don't know...[A]
Maybe they found out about the
Dragons that live in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Dragons!?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes...
Arcadia was built by Dragons and people[A]
joining forces a long time ago...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]...Such a place existed...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy...
Please, save our village...[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]But the story does seem

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]In any case, it's probably true that

Please take it.[A]

Fa's tired![A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't be stubborn.[A]
Now go, or else Bern's
soldiers might find us.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]What about Sophia?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't know...[A]
Maybe she was caught by
Bern's troops.[A]
[OpenFarRight]If we get caught by Bern, then
can we see the outside world?[A]
[OpenLeft]Fa, no.[A]
The elder said that we mustn't
communicate with the outside world.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][NormalPrint]Aw...
Please?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[A]
... But I wonder how Bern
found out about our village...[A]
Perhaps it has something to do
with the ominous 'force' that[A]
Sophia said she detected
from the soldiers...[A]
[OpenFarRight]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenLeft]![A]
I shouldn't be thinking about
such matters now![A]

[OpenMidLeft]A band of mercenaries and some
Dragons have arrived as[A]
reinforcements, but General
Narshen's group hasn't arrived yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is he doing?[A]
He must know it is impossible to
take over the village with[A]
such a small army like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Anyway, we must inform the King

Zeiss, I want you to go to Aquleia
and report to King Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What do you want
me to say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Dragons do indeed inhabit
this village.[A]
According to a captive, there are
also signs of 'Divine Dragons,'[A]
the most powerful even among Dragons.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Make it quick.[A]

I can't see three meters ahead...
So in which direction do we move?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes...
Head to the Northeast...[A]
But...[A]

[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]But, my dear Maggie, we don't want
to get lost in the sandstorm, do we?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Of course not, Rose.[A]
Then we wouldn't be able to

[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Well then, Maggie, do you think we
should pass up the hidden village?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, you forget
there are rumors of vast[A]
treasures hidden in this village.[A][OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
Well, we certainly don't want to
miss that, do we, Maggie?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course, Rose.[A]
We can make a lot more money

[OpenRight][MoveFarRight]But we don't want to get
lost either, do we, Maggie?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose,

We may follow the people
we saw heading into[A]
the desert earlier.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That's a wonderful idea, Maggie.[A]
And once we reach the village,
we can thank them by smashing[A]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course, my dear Rose.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Well then, Maggie,
shall we be off?[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Elder, do you know anything

[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What!
There are Dragons in Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we have seen them.[A]
[OpenLeft]Why...?[A]
Dragons do not exist anywhere
except here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11B]Elder,
if I may.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]What is it, Igrene?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia said that she could detect an
evil 'force' coming from Bern's troops.[A]
That may have something to do with the
Dragons Roy says he saw at Bern.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Perhaps...[A]
But I am too old to detect
such force now.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]'Force?'
What is that?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia is half dragon, half human.[A]
That gives her the ability to detect
the pulses emitted from other Dragons.[A]
But because she cannot detect them
clearly, she only said that she felt a[A]
Force that was twisted unnaturally.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I think that you should
look into it.[A]
Elder, if you would allow it,
I would like to ask to join[A]
Roy and look into Bern for myself.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]I really do not want to deal
with the matters of the outside...[A]
But this is a time of emergency.
Well then Roy, will you take her?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I am Igrene,
the Guardian of Nabata.[A]
I have confidence in my skills

[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]General Raeth, about the

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Girl?[A]
The one that was scurrying around
the outskirts of the castle?[A]
Are you still worrying about
that thing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Just throw her out.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]But sir,
she was carrying this.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]?
Is this... a Dragon Stone?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... That is what I thought also,
so I decided to report.[A]
[OpenRight]Have you ever seen
a Dragon Stone before?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes,
when we invaded Lycia.[A]
The Mamkutes were carrying them
when they were in human form.[A]
[OpenRight]... But it looks different from
the ones that they held.[A]
Well anyway, it still has to
do with the Dragons.[A]
I suppose we should inform
King Zephiel about it and[A]
follow his instructions.[A]
Make sure that the girl[A]
stays inside the castle![A]
[0145]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Fa has been taken to
that castle over there?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]Yes.
The locals have witnessed it.[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B]Roy, I am truly sorry...
One of my people has caused you[A]
great inconvenience, when we must
be hurrying toward Aquleia.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]No, please don't worry about it.
If she falls into the hands of Bern,[A]
that in itself would be a disaster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe she would be safe as long
as she remains in human form and[A]
doesn't show anyone her Dragon Stone.[A]
[OpenRight]Dragon Stone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, when Dragons are in their human[A]
form, they seal their powers into
crystals called Dragon Stones.[A]
In this world, it is said that
Dragons must use vast amounts of[A]
energy to maintain their actual
form, so they usually remain in[A]
human form to minimize energy consumption.[A]
[OpenRight]Maybe the 'humans not human' in Bern
were in human form for the same reason.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]By listening to the story you told
us earlier, probably you are right.[A]
It is also said that Dragons started
taking human form ever since the end[A]
of the Scouring.[A]
[OpenRight]That long ago...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy,[A]
the spy we sent to the
castle has returned.[A]
[OpenRight]What did you find out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems that a lot of soldiers
have been coming out of the castle.[A]
They seem to be fortifying the
defenses around it.[A]
[OpenRight]Oh...
Maybe they found out Fa was a dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And the troops protecting the border
seem to have noticed us.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to rescue her quickly.[A]
[0146]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Percival,
you must not force yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Douglas, please do not worry about me.
You must return to King Mordred's side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Getting rid of the
Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
That is a job that requires the
Knight General's assistance.[A]
But still you were sent...
Roartz, that snake.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He must be wary of my
turning against him.[A]
He must be thinking that if I
were stationed at Aquleia, I would[A]
murder him in his sleep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That man, worrying about traitors?
Ha![A]
Why, he was the first to
betray his loyalty to the king![A]
The dastard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, Lord Douglas, it just goes to show
that not many have such loyalty as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Rubbish.
Look at yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... When Prince Mildain was still
alive, I had no hesitations.[A]
I believed that I would dedicate
my life to him and the wellbeing[A]
of Etruria.[A]
And this mission...
It is to protect the king's life.[A]
That should be enough reason to
fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you hesitate now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, slightly.[A]
But it matters not.
Nothing will change if I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Percival, my speech from this point is
merely to myself. Do not reply to it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria...[A]
will most certainly fall with
the king before this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
Lord Douglas!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen![A]
No matter what happens,
I will stay by the king's side.[A]
But you, Percival, you are
different.[A]
You are the one who will lead
tomorrow's Etruria.[A]
I cannot say when, but I
firmly believe that Etruria[A]
will be blessed with prosperity
once more.[A]
So, Percival, you must leave
Etruria and wait until that[A]
time comes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Lord Douglas!
What does...[A]
 [OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]General Percival![A]
We have confirmed the
Lycia Alliance Army up ahead![A]
What are your orders, sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now go!
I will return to Aquleia now.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]... Move forth!
Pursue the Lycia Alliance Army![A]
[0147]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is gonna be a battlefield too...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So what do we do, Boss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The army's gonna loot the villages anyway.
'Suppose we better ransack em' first.[A][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Awright, Boss![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But make sure you don't do any
unnecessary killing, you got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Got it...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]That guy's too nice...[A]
Well, I guess we can
make it the army's fault.[A]
[0148]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft]General Raeth,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Send them out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[0149]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B]
[OpenMidRight]Percival.
It is good to see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![.....]
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you forgotten my face?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...it cannot be.
The prince...is dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I understand your confusion.[A]
After all, a man who was pronounced
dead is standing before your very[A]
eyes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain![A]
You were alive...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have troubled you for a long
time now.[A]
...It has been over a year since I
was assassinated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Assassinated!?[A]
Your Highness, did you not fall
off your horse in accident?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.
I was shot with a poisoned arrow.[A]
First to my horse...and then to
me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Douglas noticed first and made it
public that I had been killed.[A]
A different corpse was placed in
coffin, and everything was set up[A]
as if the assassination had been
successful.[A]
Douglas then entrusted me to his
adopted daughter and let me escape[A]
to the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Douglas did that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even after I escaped to the west,
I suffered from a high fever[A]
caused by the poison for many
months.[A]
I was hovering so long between
life and death that Douglas'[A]
daughter gave up hope countless[A]
times.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]The resistance forces helped me by
giving me medicine.[A]
Ironic, is it not?[A]
They, who were fighting against
Etrurian nobility, had saved the[A]
life of the Etrurian Prince![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I recovered... slowly.[A]
And then I saw the horrors being
committed by the Etrurian nobles[A]
in the area.[A]
I felt ashamed that I had not
noticed when I was still residing[A]
on the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidRight]While aiding the resistance forces, I
was looking for a chance to return to[A]
the mainland.[A]
Then Roy came along, and I saw my
chance.[A]
And that is how I ended up here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince...[A]
I am truly thankful that
you have returned alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am with the Lycia Alliance Army
right now, but I must still hide my[A]
identity.[A]
And if I still have the loyalty
you pledged to me in the past...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am at your service,
my Prince.[A]
My master is only one, and he
is you, Prince Mildain.[A]
[014A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Percival![A]
It is you, isn't it?
I was looking for you![A]
I am...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[ToggleSmile]Wait! Wait!
Stop your horse![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you know!?
I thought we met before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I sort of recall seeing you
at Douglas's manor.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
That's me.[A]
You do know me, then![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But the girl I saw there was
a little more...ordinary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?
Ah, no matter.[A]
Anyway, my name[ToggleSmile] is Lalum.[A]
I'm here under the command
of Prince Mildain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain...?
Don't be daft.[A]
The prince was killed in
an accident the year before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
Look at this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!![A]
That emblem...
belongs to the prince...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now do I have your attention?[A]
Then look at this letter too,
the prince told me to give it[A]
to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
It is the prince's handwriting...[ToggleMouthMove]
So he was alive![A]
Then I hesitate no more.[A]
If the Prince is in the Lycia
Alliance Army, then I must do[A]
the same.[A]
[ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wha-?
That was quick...[A]
I was hoping things to get more
dramatic...[A]
Like,[A]
'If you would still fight us, then
you would have to cut me down first!'[A]
Or something like that...[A]
[014B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Why?
Why do you attack the villages?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?
Who do you think you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tell me your reason
for attacking the villages![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reason? ...[A]
Well, I guess I could say
that it's your fault.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our fault?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yup.[A]
Because you idiots are causing wars
like this, there are more and more[A]
people like me who have to do
banditry to get food.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We are fighting to help
people like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right, I've heard that enough
times now.[A]
Look at reality, kid.[A]
They all say they're trying
to help, but it's all words[A]
and empty promises.[A]
Where's the action?[A]
You got your head in the clouds, you
can't see what goes on the ground.[A]
Get it?
Now get out of my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What!?[A]
Listen, I ain't playing
games with you.[A]
If you don't get the[A]
hell out of here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I won't move.[A]
If you want to kill me,
then you may do as you wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If I let you pass, I would just
be another one of those people who[A]
you say are all talk and no action.
I am telling the truth![A]
We are fighting to help the people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]You... Hehe...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I never thought I'd meet anyone
so naive to think as you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you...
laugh at us...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]But still, it's nice to hear[A]
once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]!
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]All right, you win.
I'll stop looting.[A]
But you gotta let me
fight with you guys.[A]
I gotta see with my own
eyes that you're[A]
true to your words.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
If you fight alongside us,
I'm sure you will understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, you certainly seem
confident about that.[A]
I'm Garret.
And you're...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina?[A]
Well then, I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance, milady.[A]
[014C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]General Percival![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Roy.[A]
I wish to join your cause.
Would it be all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
Someone of your ability
would always be welcome.[A]
But why have you suddenly
[ToggleSmile]changed your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Must I answer
that question?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I wouldn't force you
if you have a reason not to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive me.[A]
I shall tell you
when the time comes.[A]
[014D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15F]
[ToggleSmile]The little girl that was running
around here...[A]
She got taken away to
the castle.[A]
Here, I'll give you this,
so you can rescue her?[A]
It was a book that our priest
was always carrying.[A]
... He got taken away to the castle, too.
But he never returned.[A]
[014E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x160]
This is the Hammerne staff.
It can repair your weapons, spell books,[A]
and staves. But there's one thing
it can't repair,[A]
and that's itself.[A]
[Clear]
It can repair anything...[A]
But the staff itself
just rots away.[A]
[014F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15E]
I've been hearing about
bandits in these areas.[A]
Sigh... They must be brutal
and savage killers.[A]
[0150]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x161]
The rumors say that the Three
Etrurian Generals have become divided..[A]
but so have the people's
hearts. I can only hope they[A]
don't start fighting each other...[A]
[0151]
[LoadFace][0x143][ToggleSmile]Gah...!
Hmm...[A]
There must be a reason you
attack this castle...[A]
But what...?[A]
[0152]
[LoadFace][0x143]
[ToggleSmile]Gah...!
That girl...
She isn't human, is she![A]
Why... do you seek her...!
To use her power...? ...![A]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
Here she is![A]
[OpenMidRight]You found her?
Wait, I'm coming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Now young lady,

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][FastPrint]... Sniff...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's ok, Merlinus.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]... Now, why did you follow us?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Fa just wanted to
see the outside world...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]What!
For such a reason...[A]
Do you know how much
confusion you have caused?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]But... but...
[MoveLeft]Fa's never, ever allowed outside![A]
The elders say that Fa has to

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Master Roy,
what shall we do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]... You've suffered a lot.[A]
But do you understand that you've
worried the elders and caused[A]
a lot of inconvenience?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Fa's sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Really sorry?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well then,
you can come with us.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]Really!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy might already know
about her.[A]
In that case, it's better
to have her where we can see[A]
her rather than letting her go
off back on her own to Arcadia.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yay![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Hush!
Don't get too excited.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you mustn't go off

Lord Murdock, is here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
H-Hurry![A]
Send someone out to escort him here!
Make sure he gets utmost attention...[A]
[OpenRight]He is already here..[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x147]Enough.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L-Lord Murdock...
What a pleasant surprise![A]
What brings you all the

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]Narshen, I believe you
owe me an explanation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry sir...[A]
I don't quite understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere has escaped, again.[A]
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed
in his mission at the Western Isles.[A]
Also, you have neglected the mission
of capturing the hidden village in[A]
Nabata as given from the king himself![A]
Narshen![A]
I want explanations.
Now![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Y-Yes...[A]
Well you see, my Lord, there have
been many complications, and..[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Enough.
I have orders from the king.[A]
You are to be demoted from Dragon
Lord status.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]His Majesty wants Gale
to take your place.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]My Lord!
Please wait![A]
Please give me one more chance!![A]
[OpenMidRight]... The Lycia Alliance Army is
approaching here.[A]
Show me your worth, and stop
them.[A]
If you succeed, I will negotiate
with the king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Murdock...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Narshen...[A]
Don't fail the king..
or me, again.[A]
[0157]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x142][ToggleSmile]Rubbish!
Me, demoted?![A]
And my replacement is that Gale...![A]
Never![A]
I will not allow that to happen![A]
B-But what can I do...
No...![A]
My honor, my status...
It's all collapsing![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][FastPrint]General Narshen,
the enemy is getting close...[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Quiet!
I know that.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... Wait.[A]
Miledy's younger brother is
stationed in this castle...[A]
and she's the one who let
the princess escape![A]
Ah![A]
I can say we failed because he
was leaking information to the[A]
enemy and get rid of him later![A]
Hehehehe...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]General Narshen...
What were you thinking?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
Oh, you know Miledy's
younger brother, don't you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you mean Sir Zeiss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Right, Zeiss.[A]
Anyway, he's suspected of
[ToggleSmile]leaking information to[A]
the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Capture him and bring
him here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]What?[A]
But Sir Zeiss would never
do something like that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]Shut up![A]
All you must do is
follow my orders![A]
Now bring him here![A]
[0158]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,[A]
this is the palace of Aquleia.[A]
According to the information we
have gathered, the Coup d'etat[A]
forces are stationed inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bishop Yodel,
I thank you for your help.[A]
Thanks to the Elimine Church, we were
able to avoid fighting in the city[A]
and killing innocent people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No,
I must thank you.[A]
Our order was being prejudiced
by the Coup d'etat group, so if[A]
you hadn't come along to fight,
we would have been driven out of[A]
the land a long time ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prejudiced?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Most likely because we were
investigating Bern's Dragons.[A]
Saint Elimine, our founder, said[A]
this before she ascended to heaven,
"Never allow the Dragons to[A]
be brought back to the world...
It would mean death for many[A]
people."[A]
Therefore, we are making our best
efforts to find a way to[A]
send the Dragons back to the
world in which they belong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If the Coup d'etat forces had
joined with Bern, then of course[A]
they would want to stop you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]We also found
out this.[A]
The resurrection of the Dragons
is somehow tied to the Fire Emblem,[A]
Bern's greatest treasure.[A]
That's where I sent Saul
and Dorothy to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, you must stop the
Coup d'etat troops.[A]
And if you would allow me to
give you further advice,[A][SendToBack]
I would suggest that you do
not do any unnecessary killing.[A]
I am sure there are troops that
had no choice but to join the[A]
coup d'etat due to inner reasons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]May Saint Elimine bless you,
Master Roy.[A]
[0159]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x146][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]T-The enemy is right
at our doorstep![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x13D]Oh... what must we do![A]
If we get caught, we shall
be prosecuted as the initiators[A]

gotten rid of the Lycia Alliance[A]

[OpenRight][MoveRight]B-But Lord Roartz...!

This is not the time
to be arguing, my Lord![A]
We must escape![A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]But escape to where...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]... Let us turn to Bern![A]
This is originally
their plan...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Y-Yes, of course![A]
We have done what they
asked of us.[A]
They would be sure to

[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10A][FastPrint]... May I ask what you intend
to do with the king?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Er... No, they would
not harm the king.[A]
After all, King Zephiel's
mother was from Etruria.[A]
Anyway, Douglas, you must
escape too...[A]
[OpenFarRight]I refuse.[A]
I was originally fighting alongside
you because King Mordred's safety[A]
was at stake.[A]
I had no intention of going along
with your plans.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Hmph!
Stubborn as always, I see.[A]
Suit yourself.

I suppose I can leave those two

If Prince Mildain returns...[A]
Etruria will pull itself together
again.[A]
And until then... I shall fight

Just now, General Narshen gave an

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
Does he think that
I am betraying Bern?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He is trying to put the

on your shoulders.[A]
He is saying that you worked
with Miledy to leak information[A]
to the enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]With my sister?
We don't even know where she is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Miledy has apparently joined
the Lycia Alliance Army alongside[A]
the Princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]!![A]
Miledy turned to the enemy?!
I don't believe it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then get the story from
her yourself.[A]
I want to go with you as well,
but I have been told by[A]
Lord Murdock to watch the battle

Zeiss, I want you to escape when
you see the chance and go speak[A]
with your sister.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Gale said that you had joined
the enemy.[A]
But I couldn't believe it until now,
when I can see it with my own eyes![A]
Why!
Why did you betray Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never betrayed Bern.
I just wanted to help Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you threw away everything...
Your homeland, your family...[A]
Even your lover...

For that... stubborn princess who
betrayed her own brother![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]It is the princess, not the king,
who is truly working for the good[A]
of Bern.[A]
Granted, I was angry when the
princess left without consulting[A]
me at all.[A]
But now that I am at her side,
I understand more than ever..[A]
That she had not made a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... Sir Gale was right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What? Gale?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He said that he didn't intend

I had saved you from a hard[A]

[OpenMidRight]... You saved me from that terrible

[OpenMidLeft]... Is it that we must attack Bern
as well after Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
Did someone inform you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[A]
...But I knew that it would
happen eventually.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... We cannot leave Bern running
around freely any longer.[A]
I am sure that it would be hard
to see your nation invaded, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]... Roy,
I will give this to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]What is this?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]It is Bern's greatest treasure...
the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]What!?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]In the south of Bern lies
a temple called the Cave of Seals.[A]
In it lies the sword that our founder,
Hartmut, used.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is it...
one of the Divine Weapons?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It is said to be so.[A]
However, the sword was so immensely
powerful because it was made to slay[A]
the 'Dark Dragon', the leader of the
Dragons during the Dragon Human wars.[A]
Therefore, after the war, the sword
was sealed in the cave.[A]
The Fire Emblem is the key to open
the door to it.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The key...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My brother...is trying to force
the world into submission with[A]
military strength.[A]
That is something that is not
forgivable, no matter what the[A]
reason.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]To stop him, all we can
do is defeat the Dragons[A]
that are by his side.[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]... My name shall be stained in

betrayed her nation.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]No...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I shall be hated all my life

When we invade Bern, please
do not harm the civilians...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
Lord Murdock, did we really
not have to aid him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those were the king's orders.[A]
Besides, the Bern army has no

up his own mess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x13D]Lord Murdock...
What will become of us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Arcard, I will entrust this land

Lord Roartz, I will have you take
the land of Edessa.[A]
Please make preparations to retaliate.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What!?
Raemy is right on the border![A]
The enemy will arrive in no time![A]
[OpenMidRight]True.[A]
But this position also allows us
to easily launch an attack on Etruria.[A]
Make sure this castle does not fall.[A]
[OpenLeft]Edessa...[A]
It is in the outer wastelands
of Ilia...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would have plenty of time to
prepare your defenses, would you not?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]... You...
could not take back Etruria for us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is possible.[A]
But when we win, Etruria will
go under Bern's rule.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]No!
That will not do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I suggest that you find a way
to deal with the situation yourself.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Don't worry.[A]
Bern's code says that every

his own consequences...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I must admit, he has done a superb

If you had not captured Aquleia,

This is nothing in comparison

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I am glad that I could be

May I ask a very important favor?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, anything that
I am capable of.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you find out anything
else about the Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[A]
If I discover anything new,
I will report to you immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you![A]
...Oh yes, I must tell
[ToggleSmile]you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,
exposing a sand bar that can be crossed.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]A sand bar?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
If you were to go all the way
around to attack the castle, it[A]
would take much time.[A]
However, if the sand bar were
crossed, it would not take as long.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But please be careful.[A]
Rushing is not always the
best tactic to win a war.[A]
[OpenRight]Yes.
Thank you for your advice.[A]

Let her pass.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][FastPrint]What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Are you Niime,
the Hermit on the Mountain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So, some have begun calling me
that, have they?[A]
Then I must be that Niime.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hear you are capable of using
the ancient spell book that[A]
we found in this castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I should be able to.[A]
I have been studying the dark arts and
ancient magic for centuries now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that this spell can change
the climate and weather around the caster...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]It wouldn't be
entirely improbable.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then I order you.
Use the spell book and create rainfall.[A]
Make it rain so that the rivers will
overflow and push back that Etrurian[A]
Army that is advancing on us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well I can try, but frankly I
can't guarantee that it would work.[A]
Also, powerful spells like these can
only be cast once.[A]
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Silence![A]
All you must do is follow my commands.[A]
You were the one who came to us and said
that you wished to join our forces.[A]
Then make yourself useful.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere...[A]
We are getting closer to
Bern's army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since we are getting closer,
we are clashing with soldiers from[A]
Bern more and more often.[A]
It will not be long before we
engage in full combat with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish to ask you
something before we do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have been hearing rumors...[A]
That King Zephiel rose to the
throne because he killed his[A]
father, the former king.[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I could not believe it.[A]
You tried to stop him even by
casting away your nationality.[A]
If King Zephiel is such a mad
individual as the rumors say, then[A]
you would not have thought of[A]
doing what you did.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinevere,[A]
I accepted the Fire Emblem not
to use it in battle, but to try[A]
and find a use for it to end[A]
this war peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Therefore, please tell me
the truth about the rumors...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I... I'm sorry.
Please... give me some time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]... What is the matter?[A]
Princess Guinevere was running off...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]... No, it's nothing.
Did you want something?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have gathered some information.
We may have some trouble with this battle.[A]
A powerful dark magician by the name
of Niime resides in the enemy ranks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Dark Magician...
A Druid, probably.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She is apparently extremely learned in
ancient sorcery.[A]
She has much more knowledge than
any scholar could dream about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But we can't pull back now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
but we can always be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.
We must be wary![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is the spell ready?
Niime![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]... I'm warning you for the last time.
I really have no idea what will happen...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just shut up and cast the spell![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sigh.... All right...[A]

You did this on purpose![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What are you talking about... I warned

[OpenMidRight]Quiet! Someone!
Throw her into the dungeon![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][NormalPrint]Yes sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][SendToBack]Sigh....[A]
[0189]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What... happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy, we have a report.
The rivers have apparently frozen over.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ice is so thick that knights
on horseback can cross them with safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh...[A]
Well, good, we can advance more
quickly now.[A]
Charge toward the castle gate![A]
[018A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x192]
I was told that this Goddess Statue
would bring me good luck...[A]
But I pray to it everyday,
and nothing happens.[A]
That con man tricked me!
Here, take it.[A]
Just looking at it
is making me angry.[A]
[018B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x198]
Hey, when I was playing outside,
a ring fell from the sky![A]
...God gave it to me?
No way! Probably someone[A]
riding on a pegasus or a
wyvern dropped it.[A]
Here, take it.
I prefer my dolls.[A]
[018C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x194]
Are you the Etrurian Army?
Sigh... Just the other day,[A]
Bern's army went marching by.
When will we have peace again?[A]
Here, take this.
Use it to end the war.[A]
[018D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18F]
That Martel who's guarding the castle...
He said he had some secret[A]
weapon to use against you guys.
I'd be careful if I were you.[A]
[018E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x190]
When it gets cold enough,
the rivers around all freeze over,[A]
and we can get to the village in
the east without much trouble.[A]
But it's not quite the
season, unfortunately.[A]
[018F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18D]
You seem to be strong.[A]
But I heard that somewhere there's
a man called the 'Sword Saint'[A]
who is unimaginably powerful.
[0190]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x196]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, are you the Etrurian Army
that the old lady was talking about?[A]
I heard for some reason, she was
originally planning to join you[A]
guys, but for some reason she
went along with Bern.[A]
What is she thinking?[A] 
[0191]
[LoadFace][0x1D4]
[ToggleSmile]Blast![A]
How could you have traversed

[OpenMidLeft]Finally I have been released
from the clutches of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Niime.[A]
I live in the mountains to
study arcane magic.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You say you were released.[A]
Did you not join Bern out of
your own will?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well I did,
but it was only a guise.[A]
Bern's army had something that I
wanted to study.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is that?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well well, that got you
interested, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Dragons you speak of...[A]
They are not the wyverns that
Bern's Dragon Knights use,[A]
but the strange troops that are
mixed in with Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
Those are the Dragons that were
supposedly defeated in the[A]
Dragon Human wars.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you know this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought that this was only another
war that Bern started at first.[A]
But then I began to see strange...
evil things among their troops.[A]
So I decided to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And did you find out anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only[A]
decipher so many of them.[A][.....]
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dark Dragon...[A]
That is the leader of the Dragons
that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Dragons are simply a much more
advanced species than us humans.[A]
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.[A]
However, there was one thing that
the Dragons lagged far behind the[A]
behind the humans in.[A]
The Dragons' reproductive system
was much less efficient than[A]
that of the humans.[A]
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had power to create more[A]
more Dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from
my research.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It can make more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon can create more
of its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[A]
I want to learn more about
the Dragons.[A]
Let me accompany your travels.[A]
I wield Dark Magic...[A]
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
We want to learn about
the Dragons as well.[A]
It may be dangerous,
but if that's okay with you,[A]
you're welcome to join us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
The enemy has arrived.[A]
They are on the other side
of the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]So, they've arrived.
It starts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain,
are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian Army is saying that
they would liberate us from Bern.[A]
In that case, we would gain
independence...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you really believe what
they say?[A]
What idiot would fight a war for
the sakes of others?[A]
Once they defeat Bern, they would
station themselves as the next[A]
dictator.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then it's better to be with Bern.
They're better at warfare.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Come now, we have more
immediate problems.[A]
We've got to get rid of the enemy
that's right in front of us first.[A]
Are the ballistae ready?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The archers are all at their
stations.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good!
Shoot at them from a distance.[A]
They'll be floundering around in
the dark in this powerful blizzard.[A]
Observe nature's wrath...[A]
[0195]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Such strong wing and hail...
I can't see 3 meters in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ilia's winters are always like this.[A]
Well, you can't complain if you're
fighting a battle in winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We must attack now so that Bern
doesn't have the time to recover.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That's true.[A]
It would be a disaster if the Dark Dragon
was really brought back to this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe the Dark Dragon
is in human form as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perhaps.[A][Clear]
Maybe all the Dragons are in human
form now.[A]
I've also heard stories of Dragons
in human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know anything specific,
but I have read in an ancient scroll[A]
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have heard about it,
have you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, only in legend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]'At the Winter of Ends, the laws
of nature were turned upside down.[A]
Day became night,
and summer became winter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,[A]
but one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist[A]
the planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who knows...[A]
Popular belief says that the laws[A]
of nature were twisted when the
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of[A]
magical power, but I have no idea[......]
what really happened, either.[A]
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the[A]
Ending Winter.[A]
It must be more than coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[0196]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x153][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x145]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
Other Pegasus Knight squads
are headed this way to[A]
assist us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
That would help.[A]
Too bad for the enemy...[A]
They'll be in a panic if they suddenly
get attacked from all directions when[A]
they can't see in this snowstorm...[A]
[0197]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x192]
You have come to such an
isolated area like this...?[A]
The prophecies were correct...[A]
The world is covered in darkness...
A single blade of wind will[A]
slice through the darkness
and the light will shine again.[A]
[0198]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x18E]
I've pondered a lot about whether
I should join Bern...[A]
But I've made up my mind now.
Take this ring.[A]
It brings out your inner powers.[A]
...Please grant this land with peace.[A]

It's to the northeast.[A]

I can only wish you luck.[A]
The 'White Devil' Sigune

The Ilian Pegasus Knights fly

You can't see anything in the blizzard...
and then they suddenly appear out[A]
of the swirling snow. By then
it's too late...[A]
You're already dead...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
What did you discuss

[OpenMidRight]It'll get long if I tell you.[A]
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]... I have come to speak

... Is it all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I wanted you to know before

About the tragedies that have
that have occurred.[A]
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]

Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
He didn't kill his father to
get the throne?[A]
[OpenLeft]No...[A]
Our father was the first one who
tried to kill Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse
he was taking from our father.[A]
And so he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...
Why did...[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]The Dragons are indeed mysterious

What is the matter?[A]

Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... Did I appear at
a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's okay.
Did you send the letter?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Yes. I read through it,
then sealed it and had it sent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... All right, thanks.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]... Why did the former king
try to murder his own son...?[A]
[01A0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][FastPrint]Well?
Have we got enough troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
We are requesting aid from Ilia's
Knight's but all of them except those[A]
that have direct orders from Lord
Murdock are hesitant to help us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Damn!
How could this happen...[A]
Ah, we had captured Zealot's wife and
his family.[A]
How about Zealot's group?[A]
Have they responded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
They have been traveling all over the
continent as mercenary knights, so we[A]
do not know their exact location.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Ever since Sigune's group was defeated,
all of Ilia's militia have been reluctant[A]
to attack the Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Blast!
Everyone, everyone is such a coward![A]
They would have me, advisor to the

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127][CloseSpeechFast]Are you all right?

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's all right,

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]... I don't know.

Perhaps the enemy might leave,
or perhaps Zealot might return.[A]
We must have hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Where is Lord Zealot now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]In his last letter, he said that he

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...
We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
When we take this castle,
we can use it as a base to[A][Clear]
launch attacks on Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
May I ask the reason why Bern's
former king tried to murder[A]
King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
It was an arranged marriage to
strengthen the tie between Bern and[A]
Etruria.[A]
However, our father already had
a woman he loved at that time.[A]
She is my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The marriage between our father and[A]
Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Therefore, our father didn't
love Zephiel's mother and so[A]
always thought badly of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then is that why the former king
and Zephiel had a bad relationship?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.[A]
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.[A]
He grew to become a proud heir
to Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the
King try to...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Master Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]All right,
I'll be there in a minute![A]
[Clear]Princess Guinevere,[A]
I am sorry, but...[OpenMidLeft]No, it is alright.
Please be careful.[A]
[01A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]Brrrr![A]
I knew Ilia was cold,
but I didn't think it[A]
would be this cold![A]
And there's just snow
wherever you look![A]
[ToggleSmile]It's so pretty...[A]
Whoops, I don't have time
to contemplate.
Gotta' get the treasure...[A]
[01A4]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The blizzard is picking up...[A]
This might take much longer
than we expected.[A]
We should head for Bern as soon
as we take the castle.[A]
[01A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Big Sister Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany?
Why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I've been in the Etrurian Army.[A]
I was surprised when I heard that
Edessa got taken by Bern,[A]
but I knew you'd be okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Oh?
And why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were captain of the Fleet!
There's no way Bern could defeat you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]
Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]But I won't stay defeated by
Bern for long.
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,[A]
but if I joined you, I could[A]
fight Bern as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then are you going to
fight with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Really? Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does that make you
so excited?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]
I became a Pegasus Knight because
I wanted to be like you.[A]
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Tate...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a long story...[A]
But anyway,
I'm with the Etrurian Army now.[A]
I heard that Edessa had fallen to
Bern, and I was worried, but...[A]
I'm glad to see that you are
still all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... I thought you were originally[A]
fighting for the army that was
fighting against this Etrurian Army.[A][Clear]
You didn't...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
I didn't go against the Ilian
Mercenary Code.[A]
I fulfilled my duties as a
mercenary, and then joined the[A]
Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course...[A]
You're a good and diligent girl.
You wouldn't do something like that.[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's all right...[A]
And um...
What are you wearing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[A]
Why, this is my Military
Outfit, as you very well know.[A]
Well,
what do you think?[A]
Don't you think I can still go on
as Pegasus Knight Fleet Captain?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]But I thought
you retired.[A][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I can't be saying that in this
time of emergency![A]
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,[A]
but if I joined you, I could fight
against Bern as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So you're going
to fight alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]
I never thought I could fight
alongside you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't get cocky now.
I haven't gotten too rusty yet either![A]
[01A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zealot![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Are you all right?
You're not hurt?[A]
They didn't do anything
terrible to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh Zealot, I am no child.[A]
I am the ex-captain of the
Pegasus Knight Fleet, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That's true,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm all right.
I'm not hurt or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?[A]
I thought you were with
the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well,
it's a long story...[A]
Anyways, this is the Etrurian Army
only by name.[A]
It is actually made up of troops
From the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Oh... I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
I couldn't be at the castle
when I was needed the most...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no point in
dwelling on the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But you had to go
out and fight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh?
Don't you like my Fleet Captain outfit?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Of course!
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then there is no problem.[A]
You'll be seeing a
lot more of it from now on...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What!
Do you mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]I will fight alongside you as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No! No no no.
You retired long ago.[A]
So just leave the fighting
to us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even after I retired,
I had to fight anyway.[A]
Zealot, there is no safe
place in the world anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So I will fight,[A]
so I can help bring a time of
peace all the more quickly.[A]
