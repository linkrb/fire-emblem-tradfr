[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are Dragons, anyway?
Where do they come from?[A]
What are they here for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know...[A]
I don't know... anything specific...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... I see.[A]
You don't know anything about the
Dragons, but you have their blood[A]
in you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you were a normal girl, you could
lead an ordinary life, not having[A]
people hunt you down for your power...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I... This is me...[A]
Even the Dragon blood that flows in
me... it is what makes me who I am...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... you're right.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You are a strong one.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me... strong...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're strong.[A]
You really are just like me
when I was your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... I see...[A]
[0477]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you over there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hey![A]
Can you not hear me,
or are you just ignoring me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Uh...
...Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is there anyone else here?[A]
Geez, are you deaf, or just
plain stupid?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I heard you use ancient
dark magic.[A]
Is it true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Let me see your spell books.
I don't think I've ever seen...[A][MoveMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Ow![A]

What the...[A]
Did you just do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Please... don't touch... 
me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Well, well...
You dare stand up to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Ah, fine.
I'll leave you alone for now.[A]
But you're showing me that
spell book next time we meet![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0478]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]? Whoa!?[A]
Y-You!?
Damn, how could I not have
noticed you coming so close...[A]
Wh-What do you want!?[A]
Are you trying to pay me
back for the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The dark magic book![A]
The one they don't know even
exists...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes...
...You know much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I do![A]
Do you have any idea how long
I've been looking for this!?[A]
[ToggleSmile]So this is it...[A]
Wow...
I can feel it's power...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Do you want it...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can have it!?
But... are you sure?[A]
Don't you need it as well?
Why give it to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait! Hey![A]
[0479]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you over there!
You![A]
With the long dragging hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm giving this spell book
back to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?
...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't need things to be
given to me.[A]
I'm not a beggar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes...[A]
...But...
I wanted to give it... to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Because...
You are a good person...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always act strong...[A]
...But... you actually have a kind
heart... So... I wanted to give[A]
it to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have a kind heart!?[A]
Only my brother ever said something
as ridiculous as that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I know you... better than you
know yourself...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Don't talk like that.
You'll scare people off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Well, it doesn't bother me, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Thank you...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What's your name?
I'm Ray.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Ray...[A]
My name... is Sophia...[A]
[047A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Lalam.
What's up?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's happening with the plan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, the plan about
building that village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
Yeah, I've been going around
recruiting help.[A]
Are you going to help out, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
What do you want me to do?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Dance, of course.[A]
Your dancing cheers everyone up.[A]
It makes people feel like getting up
and working some more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think so?[A]
Hmm...
Well, I can cook, too.[A]
You know my Special Stamina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since I started the rebellion,
I've been eating your...[A]
I can't even bear to say it in
words.[A]
Anyway, I wouldn't call it food.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never!
I've always been trying...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, Lalam.[A]
You usually don't end up burning
the house down when you cook a[A]
proper meal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not a big loss, considering
how well my food tastes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The wails and moans of the rebel leaders...
I can still hear them echoing in my ears.[A]
Has Elphin ever eaten it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.
But he didn't say anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You see?[A]
There's something wrong with everyone
else's taste buds.[A]
My food was probably too high-
class for them.[A]
Maybe...[A]
Roy might appreciate my fine
taste.[A]
Yes![A]
I'm sorry, Echidna.[A]
I have to make Roy try my cooking![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry, Roy...[A]
[047B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Oh, Echidna.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalam.
Hey...[A]
You were talking about feeding
that stuff to Roy, but...[A]
did you really do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean!?
He praised me![A]
He said that it was really...[Clear]
uh...that it looked really good.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So he ate it, huh?
[ToggleSmile]When's the funeral?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph![A]
I just wasn't doing too well that
day!
My stepfather always said that
he loved my cooking.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, now, even if you can't cook, your
dancing is still the best in the world.[A]
I should be working hard, too, to let
the people live in peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You know,
you're really noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're always thinking about others.[A]
Even this, building a village so that
other people can live in peace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're like those heroes that appear
in the sagas that bards sing![A]
You appear, help the needy, and leave
as suddenly as you had come...[A]
You're also mysterious since you never
tell anybody about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right...I don't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I won't ask.[A]
I'm really curious, but there must be
an important reason why you won't[A]
tell us.[A]
[047C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Hey, Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just had a really
great idea![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you want to hear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm sure.
[ToggleSmile]Come on, let's hear it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay.[A]
I was thinking, when the village is
done, let's put a statue there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A statue?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A statue of you![A]
It can have an engraving that says,
'A great hero lies here...'[A]
or something like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey,
I don't plan on dying yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway, it's your village, so there
has to be a statue of you somewhere.[A]
Make sure you think of a pose for it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]She's an odd girl...[A]
Well, I guess that's nothing
new.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126]Oh, one more thing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you go disappearing on us!
We all love you, you know.[A]
Don't you dare try and
run off![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah... I know, Lalam.[A]
[047D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek!
A pirate![A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Wait a minute![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek![MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Help help help![A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Stop...
Wait![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Pirates are all the same.[A]
You're just going to say shut up, or
you'd better not say a word if you[A]
want to live, or something like that.[A]
Oh![A]
Lalam's in grave danger!
But just you wait.[A]
Soon Roy'll appear on a shining
white stallion and rescue me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, are you done?[A]
Listen.
I'm not a pirate anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph![A]
Even if you try to act good like
that, I know better![A]
I know you're trying to run off
with me because I'm so irresistible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You've got to be kidding me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Kidding!?[A]
What, are you saying that I'm
not cute enough to kidnap!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...[A]
No...forget it.
Sorry to bother you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait![A]
[047E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeek!
It's the pirate again![A]
[OpenMidRight]I said I'm not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still trying to cover
up the obvious truth?[A]
Your hairstyle, your clothes...[A]
Everything about you is just
screaming, 'I'm a pirate!'[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Fine...
Have it your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aha!
You admit it![A]
And?[A]
You're still trying to
run off with me, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey...[A]
Would you please listen
to what I have to say...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh!
Lalam's in great danger![A]
But just you wait.[A]
[0x0080][0xC282]oy'll beat you down any day![A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x126]
[ToggleSmile]'Are you all right, Lalam?'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Oh, Master Roy...'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Lalam,
I can't live without you.'[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x126][ToggleSmile]'Oh, thank you, Master Roy...'[A][Clear]
And then we...
[MoveLeft]Ooooohhhh![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hey,
where are you doing?[A]
[OpenFarRight]See you later...[A]
Talking with you is exhausting.[A]
[047F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the pirate![A]
Are you still trying to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is yours, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
I lost this ribbon the other day.
Wait![A]
I get it.[A]
You stole it, right!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why the hell would I return it
to you!?[A]
I found it lying on the ground, and
I thought it might be yours.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have if you let me![A]
You just start screaming
whenever we meet![A]
If only you'd stop and
listen once in a while...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you weren't a bad person after all.
I shouldn't have been so scared, then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hey, wait.[A]
I'll show you a special dance
in return.
Hey, wait...[A]
What![A]
Are you trying to tell me my
dancing isn't worth watching!?[A]
[0480]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
Are you looking out for me,
Tate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, you've been retired
for a while now, so...[A]
I'm sure you'll be all right,
but anything can happen, right?[A]
I was a little worried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks...
But I'll be fine.[A]
How about you?[A]
How is your work as a flight leader
going?[A]
You're responsible, so I thought
you'd be all right, but did you[A]
get along okay with your squad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't do anything special...
[ToggleSmile]but I think I did all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'm sure you did fine,
Tate.[A]
Good girl...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
You don't like having your
head petted anymore?[A]
You used to love it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]T-That was a long time ago...[A]
I'm not...you know,
a kid anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you don't like it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not that I don't
like it, but...you know...[A]
[0481]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing.[A]
I was just wondering whether
you're all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, Tate.[A]
Let's chat a little.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's okay, Tate.[A]
You can be my little sister
when we're alone together.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You're a strong girl,
but you easily get lonely...[A][Clear]
Do you remember the time when I
first left to go train as a[A]
Pegasus Knight?[A]
You thought I was leaving forever,
and you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D-Don't bring that up...![A]
I was still a little girl
back then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was glad you cared so much
about me, Tate.[A]
You were always so blunt, so at times
I thought you didn't like me at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...you cried so much at that time.
You were sobbing, 'Don't go, Yuno.'[A]
I felt like crying myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tate, if you're ever feeling down,
come talk to me.[A]
Because... I'll always be
your big sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0482]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight]Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe you should leave the rest of
the battle up to us and rest a bit.[A]
You know you're a mother now, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
Should the old ladies be stepping
back now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-No, that's not what I mean.
I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, Tate.
Thank you.[A]
But I'll be fine.
I am still an Ilian Pegasus Knight.[A]
Don't forget, I taught you how to ride
your pegasus in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know, but...[A]
[ToggleSmile]......
If something happens...[A]
I'll be there for you,
Yuno.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Thank you, Tate.[A]
[0483]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]It's big sister Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany.
Have you been well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes!
Really well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's already been a year since you
left for training...[A]
Are you getting along with the
members of the mercenary band?[A]
I heard they were all men,
but are you doing all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I'm doing fine!
They're all really nice people.[A]
And I'm doing really well in
battle, too![A]
I'm the one doing all the work.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then![A]
After we joined Master Roy, the enemies
started getting stronger...[A]
But still it's as if I defeated all
of them![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow...
That's amazing.[A]
You've been working hard, Thany...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tehe...[A]
[0484]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it,
Thany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teach me how to ride a
pegasus like you.[A]
The way you fly is really neat.
I wish I could fly like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'd like to, but not now.
We're in a battle.[A]
I can teach you when we
have some free time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The let's practice our move![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Move...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Triangle Attack![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that move mother used to
tell us about...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But we need Tate to do
the Triangle Attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... right.
[ToggleSmile]Then, um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter,
Thany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We just met after a long time,
right?[A]
I don't want us to be separated
so quickly again...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always used to stick to me like
that ever since you were little.[A]
Thany, I want you to be a good girl
and wait until the war is over.[A]
Then you can be close to me however
much you want...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... you're right.[A]
Okay![A]
[0485]
.o ait seems like the idiots
starting wars don't realize that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well anyway, if there are kids
who can still laugh, I suppose[A]
there's still hope for this world.[A]
I know it's been tough for you,
but make sure to laugh once in a[A]
while, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-Hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahahaha, sorry!
Well then, see you later.[A]
Don't mess up, you got that?[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe there is still hope for
this world with adults like you...[A]
[0486]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany.[A]
I haven't told you this yet, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]While you were away,
we had a baby girl.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
A baby between you and Zealot!?
Where, where?[A]
I want to carry her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't bring her to the
battlefield, Thany.[A]I entrusted her to the
nannies back home.[A]
You can see her when
we go home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yay![A]
Yuno's baby...
she must be so cute![A]Oh, I really want to see her![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You will, don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait.[A]
Then...
That makes me an...aunt?[A]
But I'm still so young...[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno, um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?
What is it, Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our daughter...
Is she all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm sure she is.[A]
I've entrusted her to a good friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just...
What's she like?[A]
Does she look like you or me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you haven't seen her yet,
have you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.
I've always been out working.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We shall go pick her up
once the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...we shall.[A]
[0487]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yuno,
I was thinking...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think it's a good idea to
leave a newborn baby with someone else.[A]
You should go back home and take
care of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's all right.[A]
I've entrusted her to a very
good friend of mine.
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you're her mother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fighting because I'm her mother.[A]
I want to raise her in a
peaceful time without war.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I might have told you this before, but
it would be impossible to find a[A]
completely safe place until we end
this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]In that case,
let's focus on ending this war.[A]
All right, Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
[0488]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]You're coming back to Edessa
once the war ends, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you always stay with
us after that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Probably not...[A]
I'll have to lead the mercenary knights
around looking for work as usual.[A]
We can't support ourselves otherwise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But we've cultivated most of
Ilia's lands now.[A]
If we put our best efforts in,
we could produce enough food...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But that wouldn't happen overnight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Besides, we wouldn't be guaranteed
a good harvest every year.[A]
Where would the money for our food
come from if the crops were to fail?[A]
How would we survive the winter if
we're not prepared for a failure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I must lead the mercenary knights and
collect money until we are able to[A]
to support ourselves even in times
when the crops do fail.[A]
I'll leave Edessa to you, so you
should do your best to cultivate[A]
the land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I have faith that there will come
a time when we will have good harvests[A]
in Ilia as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have faith, too.[A]
I know that there will come a time
when we will always be together[A]
[0489]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127]Treck?[......][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh...he was here just a minute
ago...[A]
Hm?[A]
What's this... did he drop it when
he left?[A]
It has a lot of small writing
on it...[A]
Let's see...[A]
...'I became a horse.'[A]
...'I tried running.'[A]
...'I got tired.'[A]
...???[A]
[048A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight]Oh, Treck.
I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, hullo,
Lady Yuno.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You look as sleepy as usual.
Oh, right... Here.[A]
Is this yours?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Ah...
Yeah, It's mine.[A]
I lost it the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought so.[A]
I'm sorry, but I read a
little bit of it...[A]
What are you writing about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I write down what kind of
dreams I have on this piece of paper.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dreams?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
When I look at it, I remember all
the kinds of dreams I've had so far,[A]
and it helps me sleep well.[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I see.
That sounds interesting...[A]
Maybe I should try, too.[A]
[048B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x127]
[OpenMidRight]Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you show me that paper
with your dreams on it?[A]
It seems I've become interested
in it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uhm... Sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][Clear]
'I was praised by General Zealot.'[A]
He comes out in your dreams
too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, he does.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's see...[A]
'The war ended.'[A]
'It became peaceful.'[A]
'Spring came to Ilia.'[A]
'Everyone lived and slept
happily ever after...'[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Is something wrong,
Lady Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No, I'm sorry.[A]
......[A]
Can you show me your dreams
sometime again, Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
It's kind of embarrassing, to
tell you the truth.[A]
But okay, you can see them.[A]
I'll go to sleep so you
can get the latest ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Treck.[A]
[048C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Noah.[A][OpenMidRight]Hello, Lady Yuno.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're worried about me?[A]
What a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm not that antisocial,
Lady Yuno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was just kidding.[A]
You seem uncaring, but on
the inside, you have a kind heart.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
You've gone through many
battles coming here, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.[A]
General Zealot helped us greatly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It's thanks to him I'm
alive right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
He always strains himself
in battle...[A]
[048D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sigune...
She turned to Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
She ambushed us in the blizzard
with her Pegasus Knight squad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Sigune and I used to be
rivals, you know.[A]
We were always competing
against each other.[A]
It all seems so... faraway
when I remember it now.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sigune always tried to act bad, but
she was really a kindhearted person.[A]
If only we weren't in times like
this, we could have...[A]
War is a painful thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... Yes.[A]
But that's what war is.[A]
[048E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x127][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to avoid developing
close relationships.[A]
Is that because you don't want to
suffer from losing that person?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wonder.[A]
It is easier to just avoid
getting close with anyone.[A]
The tighter the bond, the greater
your suffering when that bond is[A]
broken.[A]
...I think you know that better
better than any of us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Perhaps it's better to live
like you do in Ilia.[A]
But there will come a time when you
will realize that close relationships[A]
aren't all bad.[A]
Maybe you'll understand when you fall
yourself in love with someone.[A]
[048F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey!
Big sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Thany, this is a battlefield.[A]
What if an archer heard you
screaming like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.
No archer could hit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sigh...[A]
...Thany, where are your reins?[A]
You could fall off your
pegasus without them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well,
I took them off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Took them off?[A]
Thany, you never know what
can happen.[A]
So considering all possibilities...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thany, you're such a worrier![A]
Flying is more enjoyable without
all the extra gear on.[A][Clear]
See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thany, wait!
I'm not finished yet...[A][Clear]
...Sigh.[A]
[0490]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tate...
You're starting to get annoying...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm saying these things
for your sake.[A]
If you can't listen to your big
sister, I won't let you ride on[A]
a pegasus any more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany, it's your fault.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're always like that![A]
Always saying I'm the one to blame...[A]
You could say it in a little...
kinder tone...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But!
That's because you...![A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I hate you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany...
Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What the?!
What did you just do?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yuno, she... she used to
pet our heads like this, right?[A]
I'm your big sister too..[A]
So I thought I should make
you feel better...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Thany, I'm sorry..[A]
I can't be kind like Yuno,
can I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate...[A]
... Did you hit your
head or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......
This child...[A]
All right, I don't care anymore.[A]
You can fend for yourself
from now on![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait!
Sorry![A]
I just had to say it..[A]
[0491]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]Hey!
Tate![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry about the other day.[A]
But I was really happy that
you cared about me so much.[A]
I really love you, big sister
Tate![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]... How can you say such things
without getting embarrassed...[A]
I really envy you sometimes..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?
Do you love me, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...There's no need to say that
out loud..[A]
[OpenMidRight]You... don't love me..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's just that...[A]
You don't have to say it here,
in the middle of...[A][OpenMidRight]Oh... I...
didn't know.[A]
Thany...
you always hated me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, all right!
I love you![A]
[ToggleSmile]Of course I love you.
You're my only little sister.[A]
I'll...
I'll always care for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee... Thanks!
See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]That child...[A]
[0492]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Zealot, I'm sure you know
already, but my mission has been[A]
accomplished.[A]
Still, I wish to remain in this
army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.[A]
You know, fate can work in strange
ways.[A]
We were hired by the Lycia Alliance
Army, and you were hired by the[A]
Etrurian Army...[A]
I never thought that we would meet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Although Etruria didn't seem to
view us very highly, General[A]
Klein was caring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.[A]
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I understand.[A]
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.[A]
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.[A]
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and[A]
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's Yuno.[A]
[0493]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering...[A]
Yuno's... your parents...[A]
What were they like?[A][OpenMidLeft]Haven't you heard from Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
All I know is that they were
soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our mother was a
Pegasus Knight.[A]
Our parents were killed together
on the same battlefield when we were[A]
still young.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We had no other relatives to depend
on...[A]
Yuno became our mother, when she
was only a teenager...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]While an ordinary girl of her age
would be concerning herself with[A]
romance, Yuno had to be our mother.[A]
But she never complained...
She always looked after us..[A]
With a smile on her face.
That's why...[A]
That's why I always wanted
Yuno to find happiness.[A]
[0494]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight]...I have to thank you for
helping us with the wedding.[A]
You set up the place and
cooked for us..[A]
Oh, and Yuno was very pleased with the
wedding gift you and Thany sent us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really...?[A]
I actually didn't want to send
it...[A]
But Thany won't listen once
she's made up her mind.[A][OpenMidRight]Hahaha...[A]
That was an interesting gift, though.[A]
But...[A]
I have to apologize to Yuno about
that wedding.[A]
If only I had more...[A]
If only our nation were wealthier,
I could have given her a more[A]
proper and elegant wedding..[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I doubt Yuno feels that way at
all.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm very grateful to you,
General Zealot.[A]
Your wedding...[A]
I had never seen Yuno with such a
happy face before.[A]
I want to thank you for what
you've done for her.[A]
[0495]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Zealot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thany.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey Zealot...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh wait, you're now my brother
because you're Yuno's husband...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can call me as you
wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
I wanted to ask you something.[A]
How did you meet Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Perhaps some other time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?
Don't be mean.[A]
Come on, tell me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm not being mean...[A]
You'll understand when you grow up,
but you shouldn't go around asking[A]
things like that..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But I really want to know...[A]

As your sister, I should know
these things...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zealot?
Wait![A]
[0496]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Zealot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You won't let me go,
will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But I'm family to you.[A]
I want to know about my relatives...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
All right, I suppose...[A]
...We first met in battle in Etruria[A]
Yuno's pegasus squad was hired by
our enemy side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I attempted to settle things
peacefully through discussion.[A]
Yuno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.[A]
And then, things just
progressed after that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What were your proposal words?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-You want me to tell you
that much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I'm your family... aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Did you propose first?
Or was it Yuno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[0497]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]But I'm glad you turned
out to be a good person.[A]
You and Yuno really looked
perfect together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
I'm relieved you didn't
start hating me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why would I hate you?
You're strong, you're kind..[A]
And besides, you're the man Yuno
fell in love with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]By the way...[A]
What about you?
Do you have someone in mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sorry, that's a secret![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-What?[A]
After making me confess that much,
you're not telling me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're family.[A]
Family members have to have some
secrets![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Wait, Thany...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]See ya![A]
[0498]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][.....][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Behind you![A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Darn...![A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry, Miledy.[A]
I was too focused on the
enemies in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gale looked out for me like
this a lot, too.[A]
If we can survive by helping each
other out, then so much the better.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But it would be better if I
could fend for myself..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're still learning.[A]
It's all right, I'll protect
you until you grow strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Thanks.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight]But...that won't do.[A]
I have to become strong enough
so I can protect her...![A]
[0499]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Slow down![A]
You have to be more careful![A]
[OpenMidRight]I've got him![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't rush like that![A]
You were lucky you were able
to kill him...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right... I was able to kill him.
It's all right, Miledy.[A]
I was fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't mean you'll win
the next time![A]
[OpenMidRight]... But it doesn't mean I'll
lose, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss...[A]
Why can't you listen to your big
sister?[A]
I would never be able to forgive myself
if I let something happen to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You don't trust me, do you.[A]
Am I so weak that I can't even be
relied on?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss, I'm not saying that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Stop being a child.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...
Stop treating me like one![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A][Clear]
...Why...?[A]
[049A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]That's it![A]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x12A]Miledy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
What were you thinking, taking a
blow for me like that!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...So you also sometimes forget to pay
attention to the enemies around you,[A]
too, huh?[A]
Are you all right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Zeiss... What about you?
Aren't you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just a scratch.
Miledy, your arm is bleeding..[A]
Hang on, I'll go get some vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thanks for saving me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why wouldn't I?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...That Zeiss, protecting me?[A]
He's grown up so quickly...[A]
Well, it's no wonder he got angry when
I treated him like a child.[A]
[049B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pr...
Prince Mildain...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Your Highness!
You were alive!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......Have you mistaken me for
[ToggleSmile]someone?[A]
I'm Elphin...
A simple bard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
You are...![A]
But...
No, it can't be...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
Nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then I shall be off now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...He...[A]
He looks just like him.
...Too much like him...[A]
[049C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can I help you,
General Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you ever visited
Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not yet...[A]
I have been traveling through the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then do you know about the three
Etrurian Generals?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Yes, I do.[A]
There is you, the Sorcery General, in
addition to the Great General and the[A]
Knight General.[A][OpenMidRight]You are very knowledgeable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a bard, it is only natural that
I would hear about such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You insist on playing dumb,
do you?[A]
Then I have an idea as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let me see your right shoulder that
you are conveniently hiding with[A]
[ToggleSmile]your long hair.[A]
If you are but a simple bard as you
say you are, then there wouldn't be[A]
a scar from taking a powerful magic
hit, now, would there?[A]
May I have a look..?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Persistent, aren't you, Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
It is you, Prince Mildain![A]
What happened?[A]
Why did you not tell me that
you were alive?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I did not want to get you
caught up in this.[A]
But it seems I have no
choice now.[A]
[049D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cecilia...[A]
How much longer are you going to
stay mad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I understand why you were hiding your
identity from me, prince.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But, your Highness, you told Lord
Douglas.[A]
Did you not have enough trust
to let me know as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not what I intended...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall let it go for now,
Your Highness.[A]
I will be looking forward to your
explanation after the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Scary, as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have saddened not only me,
but your people as well.[A]
Please show our people that you
are safe, your Highness.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
I know, Cecilia.[A]
[049E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're a pirate,
right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?
Yeah...I guess.[A]
[ToggleSmile]That's what I look like,
huh?[A]
Man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I used to be a seagoing
merchant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
You must've made a lot money, then.
Lucky you.[A]
Oh well, I guess we poor people have
to just keep working hard..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's my bag doing in your
hand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Y-You're pretty perceptive,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Gee, thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm...
All right![A]
There's no treasure I can't
steal![A]
Be ready the next time
we meet![A]
[049F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Geeeese.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ohhh...
I think I'm drunk...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Can you stay and revive me?
Come on..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Were you hit with a
Berserk staff or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whatever you're doing, it's
not very convincing at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
You withstood my seduction moves!?
You're no ordinary man![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Gee, thanks.[A]
But you know, I'm not really
suited for that role.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I-I know that!
I was just testing you![A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll get serious next time.[A]
I'll take your stuff
without you even noticing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.
Good luck.[A]
[04A0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Geese![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Doesn't this look familiar?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, that's my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Hehe![ToggleMouthMove][A]
Guess you weren't so good after
all![A]
There's no treasure I can't steal![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, let's see now.
What have we got in here?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]... ... ... ...
... ... ...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What...
What the heck?!
This is nothing but junk![A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not junk.
Maps, compasses...[A]
It's equipment you need for sailing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What about treasure?!
Where's the treasure?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hahaha, there never was
any treasure![A]
I'm broke.[A]
Drowning in debt,
to tell you the truth.[A]
I got nothing you can steal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Erg...[A]
How come you're bragging like
that?![A]
You're broke![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've got a dream.[A]
I'm gonna go back to being
a trader and hit a jackpot.[A]
You'll see, I'll fill my ship
with riches in no time.[A]
Then you'll have something
to steal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].........[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Did... Did I lose?
Are you a big shot?[A]
...Or just an idiot?[A]

[04A1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You must be one of Ilia's
mercenary knights.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
I'm Treck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Miledy.
Pleased to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am a Dragon Knight from Bern,
as you probably suspected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
What do you think of the fact that
a knight from Bern is fighting[A]
alongside you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
You know, so what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S... So what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like people from Bern
have seven ears or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Well, yes, I only have two.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]See?[A]
We're all brothers and sisters,
you know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do... you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yup.[A]
[04A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Ahh...
That hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,
Sir Treck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
Um, you're...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Miledy.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
I was just sitting here watching
you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Watching me fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
My neck aches now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.
And I was kinda thinking...[A]
Maybe you have a loved one in
Bern?[A]
Like family or a lover or
something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...N-No, that's not the case.
I live for Princess Guinevere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, okay.
Yeah, I thought so.[A]
My assumptions are usually wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh well, guess I hurt
my neck for nothing.[A]
[04A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidLeft]Um, you're...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Miledy.[A]
Do you always forget
people's names?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's a hobby.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You are an odd individual,
Sir Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
I think I'm pretty normal.[A]
Everyone tells me that they envy me
because I look like I have no worries[A]
or anything.[A]
I have my concerns too, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the other day I dreamed
I was a horse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A horse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think this dream has some kind
of hidden meaning somewhere...[A]
It's been bothering me for some
time now, and I've only been able[A]
to sleep at night.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
Thank you,
Sir Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I feel a little better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
Why would that be?[A]
[04A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Whoa.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
My god, you're huge.[A]
And look at your build.[A]
You must be able to pull trees
right out of the ground.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, this is quite a find.[A]
There's no way that I'm letting
you go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
What?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
...I go now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait a minute.[A]
[04A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait!
[ToggleSmile]I need a favor from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.
It has to be you.[A]
You see, there's going to be a new
village built on the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are lots of people who
lost their homes in this war.[A]
There are even a lot of them from the
resistance group that I was with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lost home...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So we've decided to build a village
for those people.[A]
And we need help, you see.[A]
It'd be really great if we get some
strong men like you.[A]
What do you say?[A]
If you sign up now, you'll get
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,[A]
five days a week.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But... I ugly...[A]
I can't stay with people.
They not like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, don't be ridiculous.[A]
Just try carrying in a couple of huge
logs with that strength of yours.[A]
Everyone'll love you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Love me...?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I help you.[A]
[04A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...[A]
What...
What's your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
I hadn't told you yet.[A]
I'm...[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I dumb.
I can't remember things...[A]
...And I ugly.
Everyone looks at me...[A]
I ugly, dumb...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...My, my.[A]
Look, Gonzales, you have to have
more confidence in yourself.[A]
Yeah, you have a scary face, and
you're a bit dumber than most others.[A]
But so what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, Gonzales.[A]
I won't say that 'As long as you
have a kind heart...' crap.[A]
You're ugly.[A]
People make fun of you because of
it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
But that doesn't mean that you
should just give up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You should look over yourself carefully,
and find something that only you have.[A]
You'll eventually find something
that's unique to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, unique to you.[A]
If you have that, no one will
be making fun of you anymore.[A]
You won't have to belittle
yourself all the time.[A]
You can stand proud.[A]
[OpenMidRight]U...Unique...?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I go think.[A][......]
My head hurts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hahaha...
Take all the time you need.[A]
[04A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmm...?[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me?[A]
I... I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Treck.
Nice to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]T...T...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck Treck Treck Treck Tre...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, don't repeat it so
much like that.[A]
You're embarrassing me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shut up.
I forget.[A]
...ck Treck Treck Tre...
Okay, I remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, you're an odd one.
Hey, are you...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Um...[A]
Sorry, what was your name again?[A]
[04A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh?[A]
You, you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who are you?
I see you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I must be famous.[A]
My name is Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]T...T...
T...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...reck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reck.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
Hey, what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
It's really calm,
don't you think...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm...[A]
What's calm...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm? ...Hmm...[A]
You know, I don't really
know either.[A]
But hey, don't worry about it.[A]
It's nothing compared to the
size of this world.[A]
[04A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahhh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's so peaceful here...[A]
You know, we could make quite a
team, don't you think?[A]
Um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I Gonzales.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzales?
That's a nice name...[A]
Oh yeah, my name is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You Reck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Was it?[A]
Now that you say so,
I think you're right.[A]
Well, no matter.
Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[04AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot,
are you all right?[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
This is nothing.
We are knights of Ilia.[A]
We wouldn't lose to other nations'
knights in terms of battle experience.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
Well, I still have a lot to
learn, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.[A]
...Oh.[A]
Noah, have you written your letter
yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Letter?
Oh...that letter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
Remember what you were told
when you first joined?[A]
There are Pegasus Knight messengers
that fly with us.[A]
If he should fall in battle,
they will deliver our letters for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither of us will be able to meet
our deaths peacefully in bed.[A]
The letters are essential to us.[A]
Noah, don't you have anyone
you want to send a letter to?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well... Not really.[A]
I do recall my comrades were
writing letters, though.[A]
They were addressing them to
their parents.. .or lovers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You should do the same.[A]
Why don't you get a girlfriend
yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll think about it.[A]
[04AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...General Zealot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is it about the letter?[A]
Have you changed your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I suppose even I have someone I want
to send a letter to when I die.[A]
If I die, I want you to read my
letter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Treck and I...
And also Grant and Sieks...[A]
We all made it here thanks
to you.[A]
I'd like to express my
gratitude to you when I die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Speaking of the others...
I wonder where they are now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've no idea.[A]
But they were once under my command.
They won't die so easily.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that some were hired
by Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But that can't be helped.[A]
We give our blood and get money
in return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...General Zealot,
what do you think of that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.[A]
They say that we are vultures
attracted to blood and decaying meat.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't bother me.[A]
It's a fact that Ilia couldn't
survive without war.[A]
We are giving our own blood
as well to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[04AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Zealot?[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
No...nothing's wrong.
Did I seem troubled?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I just thought that
something had happened.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
...A letter arrived today.
It was your comrade's...[A]
Grant's will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Would you like to read it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.[A]
Then let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[04AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Uh...[A]
Oh, Noah...
You were there?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I've been here for
a while now.[A]
Well, I'm used to it, so I don't mind
you falling asleep every ten seconds.[A]
But you know, don't you have anything
else to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like practicing your swings during
marches, or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
How about you?[A]
Have you been doing anything?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
...Not really.[A]
...I guess I'm no different from
you, then.[A]
Hey, what were you doing back
in Ilia during the break?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I slept.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I mean other than that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
Oh, I went fishing.[A]
You know how the lakes freeze
over in the winter?[A]
You punch holes in the ice with your
spear and lower some string inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds exactly like something you
would do.[A]
What can you catch?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nothing.[A]
It's just fun to sit there staring
off into space holding the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really live life to the
fullest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What were you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Nothing much, really.[A]
[04AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]Treck, do you remember Casis?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Casis?[A]
Hmm...[A]
I sort of remember that name...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't remember?[A]
He's the guy that forgot to bring
his weapons to our first mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
He was getting scolded with me
by General Zealot.[A]
He even forgot to bring his horse,
you know.[A]
He was fighting on foot![A]
I never thought there'd be someone
dumber than me in our squad.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, he's dead.[A]
He was hired by Bern...
He died close to here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mercenaries are in high demand
right now...[A]
We could have ended up fighting
him if we were unlucky.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're for hire, you know.
It happens.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess you're right...[A]
I really envy that personality
of yours...[A]
[04AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm?
Something wrong, Noah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I was just thinking some things
over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thinking things over?
Don't bother.[A]
We're not made to be thinking
deeply like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I guess.[A]
You know, this war...[A]
I mean, I never meant to go out and
save the world or anything, but we've[A]
fought through a lot of battles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Ilia's the same as always.
Our kids, and our kids' kids...[A]
They'll be fighting to make a living,
just like we do.[A]
I was just wondering...
Couldn't we do anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Maybe it's just futile for us
to try and make a difference...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
That's all right, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.
At least I think so.[A]
We go through hard times, but
isn't that all part of life?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
...Hey, Treck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take me along the next
time you go fishing.[A]
[04B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Treck?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oww!?[A]
What...what the?
How come my head hurts so much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because I just hit you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?
General Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck, you were sleeping
on the job again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...sorry, sir.
I couldn't help it...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Never fails, does it?[A]
You just go right to sleep
whenever there's the chance.[A]
What's more, you're more troublesome
because you sleep with your eyes open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been meaning to tell you this for
a long time, but you lack discipline.[A]
I'll be checking on you regularly
from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[04B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Treck...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Owww!?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Uh... General Zealot?
Yawn...[A]
Good morning, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck...[A]
There are rumors going around
in the army about you.[A]
They say that the Ilian Knight Treck
is swinging his sword in his sleep![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have yet to accomplish that,
sir.[A]
...But that does seem like fun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Treck, you've got talent.
Why don't you do your job properly?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are members of the proud
Ilian Mercenary Knights.[A]
This is a battle that will determine
the world's fate...[A]
And to us, that isn't all.[A]
The reputation of the Ilian Mercenary
Knights will be determined by our[A]
actions and how we fight in this
battle.[A]
That shall have a great impact
on the future of Ilia, and thus...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[04B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Treck, are you awake?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're actually awake?
What a pleasant surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I have my moments,
too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
Treck...
You've done well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We couldn't have come this far
without you.[A]
It is all thanks to you.[A]
You can sleep as much as you
want from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
...Treck![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131]
[OpenMidLeft]You were sleeping again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Eh?
General Zealot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How many times do I have
to tell you?[A]
You should be more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Good morning, sir.[A]
[04B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can drive a ship, right?
I want to ask a favor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]From me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
We're planning on building
a new village on the Western Isles.[A]
What I want you to do is use your
ship to carry the people there.[A]
I'll pay you well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A ship, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?
You can drive one, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, I sure can.[A]
I was once the captain of a
trading vessel.[A]
There's no ocean I haven't
seen yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then why did you become
a pirate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't continue my business
in this war.[A]
We had no choice, so I persuaded
the boys saying that we were[A]
going to be pirates.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But we were originally just
ordinary seafarers.[A]
We don't like fighting or robbing
or any of that stuff.[A]
Anyway, when we were prepared and
finally set off as pirates,[A]
everyone started complaining of
stomach aches and seasickness[A]
and everything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, well.
It's amazing you got this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well, I wasn't doing
it because I liked it...[A]
[04B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even if I say we were pirates,
we were just amateurs.[A]
...We figured we'd go for easy targets
first, so we picked a small trading[A]
ship for our first one.[A]
We were able to take over most of
most of the ship without a fight,[A]
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We couldn't find any treasure
at all.[A]
The captain of the ship told me that he
was in the same situation that I was.[A]
He said that he wasn't doing well
either, so he might have to resort[A]
to piracy as well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We let them go.[A]
I couldn't steal from them
after hearing that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A nice pirate, eh?
How ever would you survive?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, that's what I thought, too.[A]
So anyway, we decided to go after
a bigger ship next.[A]
We figured we could steal from
the rich and no one would be hurt.[A]
A few days later, we were lucky
enough to come across a large[A]
trading vessel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't have to hold back
this time.[A]
We charged the ship... but when
we got close, suddenly the enemy[A]
ship started swarming with ballistaes
and archers.
It was one of Bern's battleships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My, my.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We were shot at mercilessly, and
they chased us for 3 days and nights.[A]
We somehow got away, but the
ship was wrecked.[A]
We weren't making any money, either.
Some of the boys started crying.[A]
Hell, even I felt like crying at
that time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Poor thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well like I said, I wasn't
doing it because I liked it...[A]
[04B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
What's that?
A map?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's the one trophy that
I've gotten so far as a pirate.[A]
I found it when we were
battling another band.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See the skull mark here?[A]
It means there's treasure buried
there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And did you find it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't have any money left.[A]
Once this war ends, I'll be
a merchant again.[A]
If what this map says is true, I
can go get the treasure and[A]
[ToggleSmile]travel the seas once again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't have any money left.[A]
I even went into debt to feed
the guys.[A]
It this map's a fake, then I'll
have to let go of my ship forever.[A]
...I can't help but hesitate when
I think of that possibility.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh huh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But you know that no amount of praying
and worrying is gonna get you that[A]
treasure, right?[A]
You have to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.
You're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even if that map's a fake, there'll
be other treasures out there.[A]
Anyway, you're helping us out by
carrying the residents to our new[A]
village, right?[A]
I'm counting on you.
Show me your ship sometime.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You got it.
You can count on me.[A]
[04B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]Lilina, is your magic
improving?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I think I've been getting
better since you taught me[A]
those basics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
You have a special gift for
magic, Lilina.[A]
If you practice, you'll become
a great mage like no other.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
So make sure you keep up with
your training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[04B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Cecilia, why didn't you
teach magic to Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When Roy was studying in Ostia,
you wouldn't teach him magic at[A]
all, no matter how much he asked.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah... You're right.
I didn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why didn't you?[A]
You taught it to me a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's partly because of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
Roy... you know how he is.[A]
If I taught him magic, he would have
practiced and practiced to master it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.[A]
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through mere training.[A]
What would Roy think if there was
a person with that talent right[A]
near him?[A]
He's working as hard...[A]
No, probably even harder than
that person, but he's still[A]
lagging far behind.[A]
What would he feel like?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That person...
Is it me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People have things that they're
naturally good at.[A]
It was clear that Roy wouldn't do
very well with magic, so I figured[A]
that he would be better off mastering
the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Lilina, you will eventually lead
Ostia's future.[A]
Remember this...[A]
If you assign someone to a task that
he is naturally not good at, he will[A]
waste his ability.[A]
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[04B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, don't you think
Roy changed recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In what way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He's gotten calmer...[A]
Or rather, he's more confident when
he's giving commands to the army.[A]
You would naturally become like that if
you were in charge of an entire army.[A]
If Roy didn't grow, the army itself
would be in danger.[A]General Cecilia, you said the other
day that I would be leading Ostia's[A]
future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
After all, you are Lord Hector's
only heir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think I could be
like Roy?[A]
I mean...[A]
I couldn't even recognize a
Traitor in my own castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People grow according to their
potential.[A]
Even me, I didn't know what I would
do when I was pulled from Ostia to[A]
Aquleia and was told that I would
be Etruria's Sorcery General.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you were able to
succeed because of your ability..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not true.[A]
I was only able to come this far
thanks to Percival and Lord Douglas.[A]
You're thinking that you have to do
everything on your own, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even Roy isn't fighting on his own,
you know.[A]
He's putting faith in the people
around him.[A]
That is another important attribute
for a person in power.[A]
So you can depend on people when
you want to, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I'll be glad to offer
you help when you need it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]

[.......][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What!
That's awful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel was very patient.[A]
He said that he did not mind even if
he did not gain the throne.[A]
But the people around us, who were
looking forward to Zephiel's ability[A]
to be a good king, would not allow
anyone else to be the heir.[A]
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Decided to kill King Zephiel...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel
a poisoned drink from his own hands.[A]
And that was the first and last cup
that Zephiel ever took from our father.[A]
After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.[A]
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... The former king never did
anything after that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's[A]
mother as traitors.[A]
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.[A]
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.[A]
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.[A]
At that moment, Zephiel rose up from
the coffin and...with his sword...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was but a child then, so
naturally I could not have[A]
understood what was going on.[A]
All I knew is that after our father 
died, Zephiel never smiled again.[A]
Until then, he was strict at times,
but always a kind and loving brother[A]
to me. So...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So from that moment forward,
I knew I had to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I... see...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... But now Zephiel is at a place
where he can never hear me.[A]
Roy, please...
Please stop him.[A]
Please stop him from inflicting
pain and suffering to the people[A]
of Bern and the people of other
of other nations.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if it may resolve to
the blade?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have made my resolve when
I entrusted this task to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
You have my word and loyalty,
Princess Guinevere.[A]
I swear to the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Still, I would not be able to create
actual things like the Dark Dragon can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you found Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
I found Zephiel and asked him,
'Why did you break the Dark Dragon's[A]
seal?'[A]
Zephiel was an odd man.[A]
He didn't seem to be the least bit
surprised.[A]
He looked me right back in the eye
and asked me who I was.[A]
After I told him that I was a Dragon,
he started to smile mysteriously.[A]
He then said,
'My intentions are to give the[A]
the world to your kind.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I cannot say that I fully trusted him,
but he was still the Dark Dragon's[A]
new master, so I decided to work
with him.[A]
Zephiel then ordered the Dark Dragon to
lead the world in the place of foolish[A]
humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Zephiel is dead.
What is the Dark Dragon doing now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Although he is gone,
the Dark Dragon resides in the[A]
chamber behind me.[A]
She is waiting for the chance
to free the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But her master is gone!
Are you her new master?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did not need to become her master.[A]
She was commanded to carry out
Zephiel's orders even if he were[A]
to die.[A]
Idoun has absolute obedience to
her master.[A]
She will make sure that humans are
banished from this land.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
Her heart was destroyed,
and now she's bound to orders[A]
given by a person long dead?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you feel pity, like Hartmut
did?[A]
...You humans are truly difficult
to understand.[A]
But let me tell you this.[A]
No matter how hard you try, humans
and Dragons will never be able to[A]
live in harmony.[A]
The gap between species is
impossible to fill.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not true![A]
I know a place where Dragons and humans
are living together.[A]
Dragons and humans were both brought
into the same world.[A]
They can, and will, understand each
other![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dragons and humans,
living together in harmony?[A]
Rubbish.[A]
I have no intention of
listening to such nonsense.[A]
Now, enter my domain.

[OpenMidRight]It didn't die?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, apparently the sword reacted to
its wielder's feelings and changed its[A]
power accordingly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So Hartmut didn't want to kill
it, so the Sword of Seals[A]
reacted to his emotions and only[A]
knocked the Dark Dragon unconscious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that Hartmut did know a
little bit about the Dark Dragon.[A]
And then seeing her as the little girl
Idoun, he must have felt pity for her.[A]
It is another emotion that we Dragons
cannot comprehend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pity...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And thus at the bottom of his heart
he didn't want to kill her.[A]
In my opinion, I would never leave something
that would be a danger to me alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So Hartmut's heart
changed the sword's strength...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hartmut persuaded his comrades and decided
to seal the Dark Dragon.[A]
He built a temple deep in the forests of
Bern and sealed Idoun away using the[A]
sword and a gemstone.[A]
They are what you call the Sword of
Seals and the Fire Emblem.[A]
He then created a nation near the temple
that would watch over and protect the seal[A]
from being broken.[A]
They are the ancestors of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How do you know all this?
Were you watching?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
I had been deeply wounded, so I was
leading a hidden life healing myself.[A]
I heard the story about the seal
from Zephiel.[A]
Although he said that he read it in
the ancient scrolls that are kept in[A]
the court library.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How did you meet Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]With him?[A]

I will tell you.[A]

[OpenMidRight]But what about the time when
you came to aid us in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That event was an exception
because Percival worked with me.[A]
But now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry yourself..[A]
We can return to Lycia when we
complete this mission anyway.[A]
But may I ask you to take care
of Lycia while we are away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
You can leave the Lycia Alliance, and
also Princess Guinevere, to me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]Roy...
I may not go with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The battles on these islands
are likely to become slugfests.[A]
You can never know what
will happen.[A]
I think you should hide in Etruria
with protection from General Cecilia.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x134]Your Highness, please trust me.
I understand your intentions of[A]
suggesting a truce, and I also promised
Roy that I would protect you.[A]
Trust me, I will defend
you at all costs.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...I understand.
I apologize for being selfish.[A]
Roy, I pray
for your safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you, my Lady.
I will pray for yours as well.[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was but a child then, so
naturally I could not have[A]
understood what was going on.[A]
All I knew is that after our father 
died, Zephiel never smiled again.[A]
Until then, he was strict at times,
but always a kind and loving brother[A]
to me. So...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So from that moment forward,
I knew I had to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I... see...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]... But now Zephiel is at a place
where he can never hear me.[A]
Roy, please...
Please stop him.[A]
Please stop him from inflicting
pain and suffering to the people[A]
of Bern and the people of other
of other nations.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if it may resolve to
the blade?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I have made my resolve when
I entrusted this task to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
You have my word and loyalty,
Princess Guinevere.[A]
I swear to the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel![A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What!?
Then Lycia would be in danger![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]M-Master Roy![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Your country could be in peril.[A]
Are you sure you want to be wasting
your time on a little island like this?[A]
[OpenFarRight]He's right![A]
If Bern wanted us to get away from
Lycia so they could invade,[A]
then we must go back at once...[A]
[OpenRight]...I'm not going back.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What!? Why!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Right now, it's very difficult
to judge what information[A]
is true and what is false.[A]
In times like this, the worst thing
to do is to jump to information[A]
presented in front of you and taking
action based on it.[A]
Sure, I'm worried about Lycia,
but my father is there, and[A]
General Cecilia is also watching
over Lycia.[A]
But only our army is on these islands.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That's true, but...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]If we just leave without fully
clearing out the bandits,[A]
then what we did so far
would all be a lie...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...I see you are blessed
with a wise leader.[A]
[OpenRight]What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy,
I am so sorry I tried you so.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tried us!?
So what you said was a lie!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I have not lied.[A]
But I did present the rumor in such
a way that you would easily[A]
jump onto it.[A]
But Master Roy kept his head.[A]
I feel that I would like to join
an individual like you.[A]
Master Roy,
please count me among your ranks.[A]
[OpenRight]...I don't like the idea that
you were testing us, but if[A]
[ToggleSmile]you're willing to help,
then we'll welcome you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes,
please fight alongside us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then,
back to business.[A]
What can we do to help the
people on these isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Head south...
towards Caledonia.[A]
[OpenRight]Why?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Castle Idina is located there,
where the people being sent[A]
to Mt.Ebrakhm are kept.[A]
[OpenRight]All right,
then let's save those people first![A][......]
[OpenFarLeft]Master Roy,
please take this sword.[A]
[OpenRight]What is this?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]It is a sword called the
Wyrmslayer.[A]
I hear it was created during the
Scouring to use against Dragons.[A]
[OpenRight]Wyrmslayer?[A]
This isn't a Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]No.[A]
The Divine Weapons can only be used
by those who have skill equal to the[A]
Eight Heroes.[A]
But this weapon should be useable[A]
by people of this army as well.[A]

[OpenMidRight]It can make more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon can make more of
its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now, that being said...[A]
I want to learn more about the Dragons.
Let me accompany your travels.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I wield Dark Magic...
I'm sure I can be of some assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A][Clear]
We want to learn about the Dragons
as well.[A]
It may be dangerous, but if that's
okay with you, you're welcome to[A]
join us.[A]
[07CA]

[07CB]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Then they should be
powerful allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes!
Fortune is still with us,[A]
Master Roy![A]
But...
I heard from the mercenary[A]
knights that one of the Three
Dragon Lords is coming here[A]
with a legion of Dragon Knights.[A]
If they should join the rebels,
then our chances of defeating them[A]
would become extremely slim.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy... what are you going to do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Kingdom of Etruria
might join us.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Etruria?!
Would that be possible?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]General Cecilia, the Sorcery General of
Etruria was my teacher in battle arts[A]
while I was studying in Ostia.[A]
I have a feeling that she would be
willing to join forces with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would object, Master Roy![A]
If we depend on Etruria to solve our
own matters in Lycia, we'll be[A]
sure to be their laughing
stock for decades![A]
[OpenRight]Yes, I know that...[A]
But this is truly an important
matter for Lycia.[A]
I think that we should go
for the safest and most[A]
definite option rather than
worry about the[A]
consequences and do nothing,
which would most likely[A]
lead to the extinction of Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Master Roy.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to move quickly!
I'll write a letter to General Cecilia.[A]
Merlinus, I need you to get the letter
to her as quickly as possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, Master Roy!
You are right.[A]
I shall send the letter to her[A]
as soon as you are ready.[A]
[OpenRight]Thanks.[A]
All right, everybody!
Let's retake Ostia![A]

What can we do to help the[A]
people of the isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We must go to Djuto.
The Etrurian capital is there.[A]
We must crush it to fully
liberate the people.[A]
[OpenRight]All right!
We're going to Djuto![A]
We will fight for the people living
there, and defeat our true enemy![A]

Bern surrendered.[A]
[0938]
Roy traversed underground passageway that
the Eight Heroes used to make their way[A]
to the Dragon Temple.[A]
[0939]
However, Brenya, the last remaining
Dragon Lord of Bern, stood before him.[A]
[093A]
Bern as a nation was gone,
but its spirit was[A]
[093B]
not dead yet...[A]
[093C]
Roy had a heavy heart at
having to fight these ghosts...[A]
[093D]
Etruria
[093E]
Etruria was the other powerful kingdom
along with Bern. After debating about[A]
[093F]
about Guinevere's and Roy's position,
the Etrurian Court decided that they[A]
[0940]
had no reason to attack Bern as they
had not suffered a direct offense.[A]
[0941]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at the Capital of Aquleia,[A]
[0942]
and the Lycia Alliance Army was to be
an independent squad under the Etrurian[A]
[0943]
military. To test his worth, Etruria
sent Roy to the Western Isles, where[A]
[0944]
his mission was to rid the islands of
the bandits terrorizing the people.[A]
[0945]
The Western Isles is an archipelago
under Etrurian protection lying to[A]
[0946]
the west of the mainland. Many
mining corporations have sprouted up[A]
[0947]
trying to monopolize the rich minerals
that lie in the islands' soil. However,[A]
the riches attracted many bandits, and the
people lived in constant fear of them...[A]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you not found that bard
of the resistance force?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We are still searching
for him, my lord.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]And?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It appears he has hidden
himself in a village on the[A]
outskirts of the castle...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The resistance group is
just another band without[A]
that Elphin supporting them
with his brains.[A]
I don't care what happens to
the village, just find him![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, my lord.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, I apologize for keeping
you waiting, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You seemed...
busy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh no, we prioritize allying
with Bern above all things.[A]
So if you need anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Then, as I asked earlier...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, the whereabouts
of Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you have any
information, Lord Zinc?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I regret to say
that I do not.[A]
You have already visited
the capital at Djuto?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then I suggest you pay
a visit to Bishop Oro.[A]
He resides in the castle,[A]
overlooking Mt. Ebrakhm to the north.
He knows this region better than any[A]
of us, so I would believe he'd have
some ideas.[A]
However, if even he does not know
where Princess Guinevere is, then[A]
I would think she is not on these
islands.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
I will talk with
Bishop Oro.[A]
Thank you
for your time.[A]
