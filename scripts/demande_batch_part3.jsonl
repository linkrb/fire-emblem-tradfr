[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How can I say this...[A]\n30. You have a twin brother,\n31. Ray, right?[A]\n32. So I kinda felt that even\n33. if we three were together,[A]\n34. I would be sort of left out.[A]\n35. [OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean![A]\n36. I always thought of you as\n37. family, just as much as Ray![A]\n38. [OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know!\n39.

The sword was so central to our lives...\n105. even to the point that it blinded us[A]\n106. from our own human nature.[A]\n107. [OpenMidRight]Each time I lost, I would challenge\n108. her to a rematch.[A]\n109. And then, the third time we fought,\n110. I was able to evade her first strike.[A]\n111.

No one's gonna be looking out for you.[A]\n34. You've got to be skeptical.[A]\n35. You should even be wary that I might\n36. be giving out orders just so I can[A]\n37. ensure my own safety.[A]\n38.

[OpenMidRight]Right.[A]\n47. ...If it looks like defeat would\n48. be certain, you to take Master[A]\n49. Roy and retreat.[A]\n50. I will act as a decoy for the enemy\n51. and buy time for you.[A]\n52. [OpenMidLeft]What?\n53. But then you would be in danger.[A]\n54. [OpenMidRight]Someone has to do it.[A]\n55. Then it might as well be me, who\n56. has been in Pherae the shortest...[A]\n57. [OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous![A]\n58. [OpenMidRight]...Alan?[A]\n59. [OpenMidLeft]If you're staying, then I will\n60. as well.[A]\n61. I won't allow you to go off alone\n62. and commit suicide.[A]\n63. [OpenMidRight]But you're one of a long line of\n64. knights serving the Pherae family.[A]\n65. So you should take Master Roy\n66. and flee...[A]\n67. [OpenMidLeft]How long you've served means nothing![A]\n68. Then let me ask you this.[A]\n69. Has your loyalty been less than the\n70. other knights?[A]\n71. [OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]\n72. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Can't say it yourself?\n73. Then I'll answer for you.[A]\n74. You're working just as hard as anybody![A]\n75. You've been as loyal as any of the\n76. other knights![A]\n77. I know that best, because I've been your\n78. partner ever since you came to Pherae![A]\n79. [OpenMidRight]Alan...[A]\n80. [OpenMidLeft]Don't do anything stupid, Lance.[A]\n81. You're a necessary person to both\n82. us and to Master Roy.[A]\n83. [0425]\n84. [OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Alan, about the other day...[A]\n85. [OpenMidLeft]You mean about when we lose?[A]\n86. Are you still saying that you're\n87. going to sacrifice yourself,[A]\n88. or something ludicrous like that?[A]\n89. [OpenMidRight]No, I gave up that idea.[A]\n90. ...Your words were a slap in the face,\n91. so to speak.[A]\n92. Perhaps I was belittling myself because\n93. I've been in Pherae the shortest.[A]\n94. [OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.\n95. Except me, of course.[A]\n96. [OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?\n97. I really envy you sometimes.[A]\n98. [OpenMidLeft]Of course I have confidence.\n99. How could I possibly lose to you?[A]\n100. [OpenMidRight]...You'd better remember those words, for\n101. you will be hearing them again from me.[A]\n102. [OpenMidLeft]Ha, never![A]\n103. See you after the battle![A]\n104. [OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]\n105. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance?[A]\n106. [OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A]\n107. [OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Even if we lose, you won't be the only one\n108. staying behind and fighting to buy time![A]\n109. You'd better remember that![A]\n110. [OpenMidRight]Of course![A]\n111.

[OpenMidRight]So is it...\n72. the weapon's weight?[A]\n73. [OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]\n74. Because all weapons are designed bearing\n75. in mind that humans will be wielding them,[A]\n76. it is almost inevitable that minor flaws\n77. and weaknesses would not appear.[A]\n78. [OpenMidRight]So...[A]\n79. It's impossible for a weapon\n80. to just make you really strong.[A]\n81. [OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]\n82. In the past, many kinds of weapons\n83. were made, and disappeared.[A]\n84. Among them, the sword, axe, and\n85. spear remained, thus creating what[A]\n86. is commonly known as the weapon\n87. triangle.[A]\n88. [OpenMidRight]I see.[A]\n89. But wait, what about weapons like\n90. the Swordreaver?[A]\n91. [OpenMidLeft]Well, that brings us to a\n92. whole different dimension.[A]\n93. So...[A]\n94. [OpenMidRight]..,Ah, I see...\n95.

Do you want to live your life\n43. in the shadows in constant fear[A][Clear]\n44. of being found? Is that really\n45. what you want?'[A]\n46. I ran like hell, m'lady. I fled\n47. from the castle, from his voice.[A]\n48. After that, I just walked around\n49. the area aimlessly through the night.[A]\n50.
