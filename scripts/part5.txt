[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The rebel group is supposed
to be very active in these areas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, according to
our sources.[A]
But I also understand that earlier
this week, the resistance[A]
group was hunted down by
Etruria's military.[A]
I heard that they were
devastated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The Etrurian government lets
the bandits go and opresses[A]
the resistance group who are
trying to help the people.[A]
It doesn't look good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it does not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Could we do anything
to help?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be difficult..[A]
We would be going against
Etruria's nobility.[A]
I don't think that would be
a good idea when we are working[A]
under Etruria's orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll send a messenger to
General Cecilia and see what[A]
she has to say.[A]
We probably shouldn't do anything
too risky right now, but...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy![A]
Lord Zinc who controls this area
is sending out troops to attack[A]
the villages to find a member
of the resistance force![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]What!
...Should we?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We don't have time to wait
for General Cecilia's reply...[A]
But I want to help the people.[A]
...Even if it means going
against Etruria's orders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's fight![A]
So we can be proud
when we return to Lycia![A]
[094A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x136][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12E]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, were you able to find out
where Princess Guinevere is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
But I heard a bishop named Oro
in charge of the mines in the north[A]
might know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]All right,
then let's head north.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Gale... I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the case
on Guinevere in secercy, so he only[A]
assigned my group to look for her.[A]
I'm sorry I got you mixed up into
this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You shouldn't worry yourself
over things like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of the captains
working directly under General Murdock.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Murdock has agreed to my helping
you out.[A]
In fact, he wants me to find out the
location of the Princess and the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think that Princess
Guinevere has the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that's the what the
royalty thinks.[A]
And I think they're correct,
looking at the situation.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Come on,
don't look like that...[A]
Probably Princess Guinevere
has a plan of some sort.[A]
Come, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes...[A]
[094B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Where...am I..?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15A][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you awake?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...What...happened...
to me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]We found you lying at the
entrance of the village, all[A]
brusied and blood-splattered.[A]
So we brought you home and
treated your wounds.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]And you are...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm Mary.
I live here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Live here...[......]No![A]
This village will be
endangered if I stay here..[A]
...Or maybe it's too late
if it's already been one day..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am Elphin...
One of the resistance group.[A]
The landowner is sure to send
troops here to capture me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The resistance group...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Miss Mary,
you should run from here.[A]
This village is in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...No,
I will stay.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have a younger brother.[A]
Right now he's gone out to look
for work with his friend from[A]
next door.[A]
His friend asked me to take
care of his younger sister[A]
while they was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Then all I can do to protect
this village is leave.[A]
Thank you very much
for healing my wounds.[A]
Please take care.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, you take
care too.[A]
[094C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is the matter?[A]
Why is taking so long to find one
resistance group member?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Lycia Alliance Army![A]
They are fighting to protect
the villagers...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Alliance Army?[A]
They would go against Etruria?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]We have gotten a message from Djuto.
It says,[A]
"The Lycia Alliance Army is suspected
to be working with the bandits.[A]
Capture them, or kill them,
if necessary."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?
Tied in with the bandits?[A]
How ironic![A]
So they want to kill them to
save their own skins...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is not the mainland.
Might makes right here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not quite sure
I understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry about it then.[A]
Is that all they said from
Djuto?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Lord Arcard has provided
us with reinforcements.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
[OpenMidLeft]They should be arriving soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Damn![A]
Even if we defeat the Lycia
Alliance Army, we will not[A]
get all the credit if we are
aided by reinforcements![A]
We need to do this quickly..[A]
Ah, of course!
Get Scollan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x151]Yeah?[A]
What can I do for you,
Master Zinc?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I want you to burn down
all the villages in this area.[A]
Kill the villagers as well.[A]
[OpenLeft]...What if there's
treasure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do with it as you wish.
Just hurry.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Got it, Master Zinc.
Hehehehe...[A]
[094D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x151][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Gonzales!
Where's Gonzales![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F]Here...
I here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's a village to the south.
You got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Get it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That might be a hidden base
for the resistance forces.[A]
Master Zinc says to burn it down,
village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Right.
Now git![A]
A stupid hulk like you only comes in
use at times like this.[A]
You better not screw up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You got a problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Heh, he looks like hell,
but has that damn kind heart.[A]
He shouldn't be scared of
busting up one tiny village.[A][Clear]
You guys,
you got that too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][NormalPrint]Sure thing, boss![A]
[094E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][ToggleSmile]So that's the
Lycia Alliance Army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128]They're supposed to be fighting
against the bandits...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
But Lord Arcard says that they
are fighting with the bandits[A]
to attack the villagers.[A]
Why are they doing the opposite
of what they were told to do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft].....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate, can you take your troops and
attack from the north?[A]
I'll start attacking from here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Tate!
Wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see that you have some
siblings.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I have two sistersア
one older, one younger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are they all Pegasus Knights
like yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, actually, I have a
younger sister myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She must be very beautiful
if she is your sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.
And yes, she is pretty.[A]
But I've heard she got tangled
up in some mess and I don't know[A]
where she is now..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Oh my..[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've sent out some people to look
but they haven't found her yet.[A]
If only I wasn't on this mission,
I could go look myself..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Tate, take care of yourself.
For your family's sake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,[.....]
thank you.[A]
[094F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir, are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Arcard said to leave most
of the fighting up to Ilia's[A]
Pegasus Knights so that we
the Etrurian army, suffer the[A]
least casulaties.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Don't be ridiculous,
they are trustworthy companions.[A]
We will attack at the same time...
or even before them.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Still, Lord Arcard's story
is strange..[A]
The army from Lycia just got here.[A]
...Would they get tied in with
the bandits so quickly...?[A]
[0950]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x128][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x153]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you ready?
We're going to move southward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Captain...
Are you sure we'll be all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps the Etrurian army means
to use us up front as disposables..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who says that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]One of our group members heard rumors
like that in the Etrurian army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you take rumors seriously all the
time, you won't be able to do anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Besides, if that were true,
General Klein wouldn't approve of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Klein's not like that.
I trust him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alright.[A]
Then we'll trust him as well,
for we trust you, Captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks.
Let's go![A]
[0951]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Zinc, the reinforcements from
Djuto should be arriving shortly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Damn![A]
We're having enough trouble
as it is...[A]
I don't need any reinforcements
to take all the credit![A]
[0952]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Additional reinforcements
will be arriving shortly![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
I hope this will be enough...[A]
[0953]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Excuse me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]W-What are you!
I'm an enemy![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm sorry...[A]
But you had such a sad look
in your eyes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...There is village near
mountain.[A]
You know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, I know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let the people escape.
I take order, I destroy village.[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What?
Don't![A]
The people living in the
village are innocent...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]No.
I can't disobey order.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Can't you leave the people
who give you orders like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Leave?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I know!
You should fight alongside us![A]
We're protecting the villagers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...No...I'm a monster...
I can't be with other people...[A]
People throw stones...
They say 'go away' to me...[A]
I'm a monster...
Not human...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
Of course you're a human!
You're also a kind hearted human.[A]
I can tell.
Come with us.[A]
Don't be afraid.[A]

I'm not afraid!
Everyone afraid of me.[A]

You're scared that people will throw
stones at you, and they'll tell you[A]
to go away again.[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]It's okay.
The people in our army are nice people.[A]
[ToggleSmile]They won't be mean to you.
Come on...be brave.[A]

[OpenFarRight]...Never betray your employer...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.
And we must follow that code,[A]
even if it means fighting
against your own kin.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]But...
One of us might die![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]I know that![A]
But we have to fight![A]
We can't let down other nations'
trust in Ilia's mercenaries.[A]
It's the only thing we have

Aren't you an Etrurian general?[A]
Why are you attacking us!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have specific orders from
Lord Arcard to kill you.[A][OpenMidLeft]He ordered you?
Can't you see what's happening here?[A]
The people here are suffering from
their landlord's abusive treatment![A]
And you're helping him?
You should be ashamed![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Wait.[A]
Did you say that you're
helping the villagers?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The marquess here is ransacking
the villages, saying he's searching[A]
for rebels.[A]
We're fighting to stop him.[A]
But you seem to be siding
with him, so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have no such intention.[A]
I heard that you were the ones
working with the bandits to do evil.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
Why would we be working with
the bandits?[A]
We just want things cleaned up
here so we can get back to Lycia![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Such mockery.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Arcard is underestimating me.[A]
I am not dull enough not to notice

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Do you understand now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Klein of the Reglay
family of Etruria.[A]
Forgive us for attacking you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!
Yes![A]
I am General Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Roy, I would advise you
to be cautious.[A]
Since you have turned your back
on Lord Arcard, he would be sure[A]
to gather all of his henchmen
on these isles in every attempt[A]
to kill you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If you would allow it,
I would like to join you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I wish to monitor your actions
as an Etrurian general.[A]
I should prove useful as

[OpenMidLeft]I'm now a lady, I am.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Let me ask you this.[A]
What kind of individual
is General Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...
He lacks a little finesse for a noble...[A]
I especially think he has to take
care of his hair a little more..[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Let me rephrase the question.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Is General Roy working with the
bandits and attacking the people here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]No, of course not!
We are here to defeat the bandits![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Etrurians here are evil

It is so embarassing.[A]

Are you working for them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
At least not now

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What's this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a special weapon.[A]
I treated the wounds of a traveler

A few months ago, my granddaughter
went missing. The villagers searched[A]
the mountains for her,[A]
and when they found her,
she was with a huge monster of a man.[A]
We threw stones at him and drove him off...
But my granddaughter told me that[A]
he found her crying and led her to
the village. ..If you see that man,[A]
would you give him this?[A]
It's a special axe that's effective
against swords.[A]
And...

[0966]
[LoadFace][0x14D]The people are suffering...?[.....]

Their purpose is to[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, there is a

He says he is[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let him pass.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]Ah, so you are Roy?[A]
Pleased to meet you,
my name is Elphin.[A]
I am a member of the[A]
resistance forces here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]My thanks for saving our
village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, we simply did
what we thought was right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you have rebelled
against Etruria.[A]
Certainly you had thought of that
before you took action?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so,
we did what we felt was right.[A]
Although this is a sign of rebellion[A]
against Etruria, if the truth about
these islands is made public, they[A]
will understand.
I have sent a letter to a[A]
trustworthy member of the Etrurian
Nobility.[A]
If she takes the appropriate[A]
measures, I think we can tip the
tables in our favor.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not be so sure of that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Did you ever think it strange
that Etruria sent you in to[A]
rid of the bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually yes... of course.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]This is merely my theory...[A]
But I believe that the ones who
requested your help are[A]
Advisor Roartz and Lord Arcard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How do you know that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Why did those two have to
get your army off the mainland?[A]
Could there be some kind of problem
if you had stayed in Lycia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
I never thought of it
from that perspective...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There are rumors...[A]
That Roartz and Arcard are
actually tied in with Bern.[A]
[0969]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you this this

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I wanted to thank you[A]
for protecting our village.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
I just did what I thought was right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please take this as
a token of our gratitude.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]General Klein,[A]
we will stay here and reconstruct
the area, as you directed us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]We wish we could fight
alongside you.[A]
Oh, and here is the arrow you
had us keep.[A]
I will give it back to you.[A]
Farewell and good luck, General Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[096B]

We will return to Ilia
to make our report.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, and this...[A]
Your sister gave it to me

Please be careful...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.
You be careful too.[A]
[096C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x187][ToggleSmile]Hurry!
Over here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x189]A-Are you sure?
If we get caught...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You idiot![A]
If we stay there, we have no
choice but to work and work[A]
until we die![A]
You're going to put up with
that?[A]
Don't you have family or
something back home?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If we escape toward the northeast,
there are some people who can help us.[A]
We've got to get there![A]
[096D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x146][ToggleSmile]What!
Some more people escaped!?[A]
[MoveMidRight]What were the guards doing![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14F]Somebody put sleeping
drugs in their food...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That means there is someone
among our ranks who is taking[A]
contact with the enemy.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Morgan![OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1DD][A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to pursue and
capture those who have escaped.[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes, my lord.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I will return to the capital at Djuto.
Don't let them escape.[A]
Also keep sending workhands to the mines.
I can't afford to lose that mine now![A]

[096F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin,
that castle to the southwest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
that is Castle Idina.[A]
The people captured on this island[A]
are first sent there before they
are ported to Mt. Ebrakhm.[A]
Today just happens to be the day
that the captives are sent to the[A]
mines on a weekly basis.[A]
Rescuing them will be difficult if
we have to go all to the mines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must rescue
them now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I have already sent some spies
to sneak into the castle to help[A]
the people escape.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How will they release
the captives?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have told them to send the
captives to the northeast.[A]
In other words, here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must first rescue those
people before attacking the castle.[A]
[0970]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x189][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So the people living on this
island are captured in that castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well then, let's go rescue
them, shall we?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry.[A]
I know you were looking for your
daughter, and we made you help[A]
us out like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you guys helped me,
so I should help you, too.[A]
Besides, a real man wouldn't look at
people suffering due to their marquess'[A]
greed and simply ignore them.[A]
[0971]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1DD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Morgan,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
Send them out immediately.[A]
Send them from the back so that they
can defend the castle even if we[A]
should be surrounded.[A]

I have made up my mind.[A]
I want to become a great

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I understand.
I don't mean to drag you home.[A]
In fact, I want to assist you
in your journey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Assist me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Well, I know that there are a lot of
hardships during a journey of training.[A]
So I can help you out
in tough situations...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you kept helping me,
there would be no point to my training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Would you not be able to train your
sword skills with your father around?[A]
Or do you not understand your Father's
love for worrying about you like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]No!
That's not it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well then,
we understand each other.[A]
But first we must capture that castle.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Sigh....[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I have to tell Roy that we're

Forgive my being a hindrance...[A]
[0979]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even though we've captured Castle Idina
and released the people here, it doesn't[A]
mean we've rescued all the people
living on these isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
To fully liberate the Western Isles,
we must get rid of the Etrurian[A]
capital.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So we must head for Djuto.[A]
...Elphin,
may I ask you something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Correct me if I'm wrong.[A]
But are you not someone of
high Etrurian nobility?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!![A][Clear]
...What makes you think that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
I can't really explain it, but...[A]
For example, the way you talk
sounds very educated.[A]
In Ostia, I learned how to 'study'
people and to make estimates about[A]
them.[A]
Anyway, am I right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What would you do if I
were what you think I am?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
No, I wouldn't do anything
in particular.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You must have some reason
to hide your identity.[A]
You can tell me when you
feel comfortable about it.[A]
Okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go to Djuto![A]
To save these isles and
defeat our true enemy![A]

Lord Roartz, your post will be the[A]

[OpenFarLeft]Talas!?
W-Wait![A]
This is too close to Aquleia.
The enemy is already too close![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what you must do is
defeat them.[A]
This is a good place to set up
defenses because the enemy will[A]
most surely attack here because
it is so close to the capital.[A]
We can be most prepared here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Well,
that's true...[A]
[OpenLeft]Bulgar...[A]
That is in the foreign land

I hear that there is much[A]

Is that not your speciality?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rumours say that the enemy commander,
Roy, is still a boy.[A]
But he has gone through many scandals

it further than ever.[A]
Compared to his hardships, your's are
close to nothing.[A]

[OpenMidRight]They are disgraceful cowards who cast
away their homeland and fled to safety.[A]
We must not assist them anymore than
necessary.[A]
They should be thankful that they are

Thanks to the Church, we were[A]
able to proceed thus far with

[OpenMidLeft]Please.[A]
If you had not captured Aquleia,

[OpenMidLeft]And it is night now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The perfect place for ambushing...[A]

Castle Talas up ahead

[OpenMidRight]All right.

Then please take this staff.[A]
I heard a noble princess
once used it...[A]
[0980]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17A]
We don't get many visitors
up here...[A]
What?[A]
The enemy was going to

I see...
I must thank you for[A]
informing us.
Please take this.[A]
[0981]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17D]
I hear there's a village

It's too far from here,
so nobody's ever seen it,[A]
but I wonder if anyone's
living there?[A]
[0982]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x177]

Probably a thief.[A]
I think you should tell the

[OpenRight][SendToBack]Well, last year I didn't think

Maybe fate can turn out in the

And that might be true for Bern
also...[A]

Master Roy, what is that

[OpenRight]Oh, this?
This is the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...
So this tiny gem...[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinevere wanted me
to keep it.[A]
It seemed...[A]
difficult for her to give it
to me...[A]
She must have been hoping to
end the war peacefully until[A]
there was no hope left...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm...
Trust between siblings?[A]
It didn't seem likely on
the outside.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy is Zephiel,
king of Bern![A]
It is said that he murdered his own
he father, so I didn't think that[A]
would be moved by family trust...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
He killed his own father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Didn't you know,
Master Roy?[A]
Zephiel took the throne because the
former king had died.[A]
But because the former king's death
had been so sudden, there are[A]
many rumors going around.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And one of them is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...That Zephiel assassinated him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinevere know
about this?[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CD][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian army has appeared
from the west.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
Draw them into our territory as
planned.[A]
We shall show them our strength.
Have the other clans been notified?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Although there are many clans who
are expressing their discontent[A]
toward our alliance with Bern, further
invasion by Etrurian forces seem[A]
to require more attention.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
...The Etrurian army should be
easier to deal with than that[A]
"Silver Wolf" since the Etrurian
army is an invasion force.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The clans will unite to fight
against invaders...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
That is the law of Sacae.[A]
When we were up against the Silver Wolf,
no one aided us because they saw it[A]
as a conflict between clans.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But now we have Bern behind
us, so we need not any help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly.[A]
Then of course, there are many
who don't like the idea that[A]
it is Bern who has actual
control of Sacae's politics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I hear there are many clans
who agree with the Silver Wolf's[A]
guerilla tactics and joined
forces with him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He is stubborn.[A]
His clan was defeated, so he
should join us.[A]
It is not as if he doesn't know
what happens to those who try and[A]
fight a head-on battle with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even large cities like Bulgar have
been attacked and taken over by Bern[A]
since they resisted.[A]
[OpenMidRight]From now on, those who are strong
enough to manipulate the situation[A]
around them will survive, like us.
And right now, we must use the law[A]
of Sacae to do so.[A]

It will not be long until we engage

[OpenMidRight]I wish to ask you something
before we do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have been hearing rumors...
that King Zephiel rose to the throne[A]
because he killed his father, the
former king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]I could not believe it.[A]
You tried to stop him even by casting
away your nationality.[A]

Although I'm sure that there are
remaining forces somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They must be meeting

[OpenMidRight]Can we find out where
they are meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I sent a spy out earlier,

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,
Princess Guinevere?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I have come to speak
about my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
...Is it all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I want you to know before we
enter Bern...about the tragedies[A]
that have occurred.[A]
You asked earlier if my brother
murdered the former king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In short...[.....]
it is true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
Then King Zephiel indeed killed his
own father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
He didn't kill his father
to get the throne?[A]
[OpenLeft]No...[A]
Our father was the first
one who tried to kill Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He...couldn't bear the abuse he
was taking from our father.[A]
And so he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...
Why did....[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154]...Master Roy![A]
We have found where the
enemy is meeting![A]
...?
What is the matter?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]No...it is nothing.
Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...Did I appear at a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's okay.
Where is the meeting place?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]It is in a city called Bulgar.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bulgar...
I've heard of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is the largest city in Sacae.[A]
Although, now it has been taken
down by Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
All right, we'll be
heading there soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][Clear]...Why did the former king
try to murder his own son?[A]
[0993]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13D][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They're here...!
And so quickly...[A]
Could they not have given me
the time to set up defenses![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14E]We will try and stop the enemy
from progressing any further.[A]
You can retreat to the palace
and fortify your defenses there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Can you hold them back?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We must at least try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]If you do not know whether
you can win or not...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then what would you do?
Flee?[A]
Tell me, just where do
think you can hide?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Brenya has given me
orders to protect you.[A]
And I will do so with all my
strength![A]
But you must not be afraid to
fight either![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A-All right...[A]
Then I shall fortify the inside
and leave the outside to you.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]...That is the highest advisor
of the Etrurian council?[A]
Why should we fight for him at
all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't say that.[A][Clear]
General Brenya didn't willingly tell
us to protect him.[A]
She had no choice because Etruria
joined forces with Bern.[A]
Therefore, we must fulfill our
our duties as warriors.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I have also gotten hold of
information that allies of the Silver[A]
Wolf are lurking around here.[A]
Keep on guard at all times.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir.[A]
[0994]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am sorry that I cannot find
the time to talk with you at[A]
leisure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is all right.[A]
...My brother started this in the
first place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]May I ask the reason why
Bern's former king tried[A]
to murder King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
So I am in actuality his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was the Etrurian princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
It was an arranged marrige to strengthen
the tie between Bern and Etruria.[A]
However, our father already had a woman
he loved at that time.[A]
She was my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]The marriage between our father
and Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Therefore, our father didn't love
Zephiel's mother and always[A]
thought badly of Zephiel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then is that why the former king
and King Zephiel had a bad relationship?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
Even then, Zephiel was always trying
his best to gain our father's affection.[A]
He excelled in his studies and military
training and was always trying hard.[A]
He grew to become a proud heir to
Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the king try to...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Master Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]All right,
I'll be there in a minute![A][Clear]
Princess Guinevere,
I am sorry, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is all right.
Please be careful.[A]
[0995]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x124][ToggleSmile]Well well...
So it has started.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x107]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x17B]Just when we thought Bern had
finished invading, now we[A]
have to deal with Etruria.
Sigh.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Small wonder.
This is a large trading city.[A]
Any army would want control of it.[.....]
Well then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]H-Hey wait,
where are you going?[A]
[OpenRight]I'm going to watch the fight.
Let us see how good that Roy is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What, now?
But...[A]
[OpenRight]Don't you worry about me.
Everything will be fine.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]What? Hey wait!
You're leaving too?[A]
[0996]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14E]The reinforcements should be
arriving soon...[A]
I want you to[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidLeft]open the front gate to
let the reinforcements in when[A]
they arrive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir.[A]
[0997]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D7]
[OpenMidLeft]Tell the troops to start attacking the
guerilla forces hiding in the houses.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes sir.[A]
[0998]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]All right, they should be here soon...
Open the gate![A]
[0999]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17B]
I was selling weapons to Bern
before the war...[A]
But now that they've taken
over the city,[A]
They won't pay me anything!
Here, I'll give you this[A][Clear]
Dragon-killing sword,
so can you do something?[A]
I've been hiding it from them...
You know why...don't you?[A]
[099A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x179]
Would you like a magic
ring from Etruria?[A]
People used to buy them before,
but I had to close my shop[A]
because of the war.
Here, take one...[A]
They won't sell anyway.[A]
[099B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17D]
This goddess statue[A]
brings good luck.
Well, I used to say that[A]
to trick people,
but I can't do business[A]
with the war going on.
Here, take one.[A]
It won't bring you any luck, though.[A]
[099C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17F]
Phew...[.....]
I found this,[A]
so I'm not stealing it!
I'm sure I can sell it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa!
A-Are you from Bern?[A]
No, I wasn't stealing
this sword![A]
See ya![A]
[099D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x17E]
This is a Longbow,
a favorite of Sacae clans.[A]
Here, take one.

soldiers out of here![A]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenLeft]Hm.[A]
You're not too bad,
are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-Who are you!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x152]What!?
Hey![A]
I said you couldn't come in.
Master Roy is very busy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]She kept pestering me that
she wanted to see you.[A]
But you were busy so I
was trying to drive her away.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Listen to me first.[A]
Then you can decided whether to want
to get rid of me or not.[A]
I think I have some information that
you might be interested in.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What is that?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]It is about the beasts
who change form into humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight][......][ToggleSmile]...I want to speak
with her in private.[A]
Can you leave the room?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Yes sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Well well, that got you
interested, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those beasts you speak of...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right. Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Dragons you speak of...[A]
They are not the Wyverns that Bern's
Dragon Knights use, but the strange[A]
troops that are mixed in with
Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
Those are the Dragons that
were supposedly defeated[A]
in the Dragon Human wars.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Niime.[A]
I study ancient Dark Magic in the mountains,
so some call me the Hermit on the Mountain.[A]
This war...at first I thought it was just
another battle so I didn't pay heed to it.[A]
But now I can feel the evil among Bern's
troops, so I investigated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And did you find
out anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons are indeed shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls, but I could only decipher[A]
so many of them.[A]
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to believe that Bern
has resurrected the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dark Dragon...[A]
That is the leader of the
Dragons that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dragons are simply a much more advanced
species than humans.[A]
They have much greater vitality and
intellect than us.[A]
However, there was one thing that the
Dragons lagged far behind the humans in.[A]
The Dragons' reproductive system was
much less efficient than that of the[A]
humans.[A]
But even then, the Dark Dragon...
It had the power to create more Dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from my research.[A]
[09A1]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][ToggleSmile]They allowed them to get in to
the palace!?[A]
[MoveMidRight]Blast![A]
If I go to hell, then that Roy
shall be going down with me![A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7]Lord Roartz![A]
The remainders of the Djute Clan are
saying that they'll come to our aid[A]
once they have securely hidden
the Mirugre.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mirugre?[.....]
Ah, one of the Divine Weapons.[A]
Good, we must hold our own until then![A]
[09A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is Roartz's manor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand that this palace holds
methods of attacking through little[A]
cracks in the framework.[A]
You must not think you are safe
just because your back is to the[A]
is to the wall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know much about this
place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I am at least slightly known
to know more things than most people.[A]
The rumor about the palace is
something I picked up back in the city.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you know what the
Dark Dragon looks like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I can't say I'm absolutely sure[A]
about that.[A]
But I would love to see it with my
own eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe the Dark Dragon is in
human form as well.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A]
Maybe all the Dragons are in
human form now.[A]
I've also heard stories of Dragons in
human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know anything specific,
but I read in an ancient scroll[A]
that Dragons started taking human
form only after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have heard about it,
have you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, only in legend.[A][Clear]
'At the Winter of Ends, the
laws of nature were turned[A]
upside down.[A]
Day became night, and
summer became winter.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
These scrolls are so old and damaged
so I couldn't decipher all of them,[A]
but one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster
powerful enough to bend and twist[A]
the planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who knows...[A]
Popular belief says that the
laws of nature were twisted when the[A]
Dragons unleashed vast amounts of
magical power, but I have no idea what[A]
really happened, either.[A]
But it does seem certain that Dragons
started taking human form after the[A]
Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well either way,
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[09A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1CE]Those pigs from Etruria...![A]
I shall avenge the Djute Clan
right here, right now![A]
[09A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107]Good,
the palace is in chaos.[A]
I shall fight those Bern troops
[ToggleSmile]alone, to the death![A]
[09A5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][ToggleSmile]So...[A]
This is Bulgar, the biggest city
in Sacae.[A]
I heard it was demolished by Bern,
but there are so many soldiers here...[A]
[ToggleSmile]There must be some treasure.[A]
[09A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you the Etrurian General
leading this group?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Dayan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dayan...?
I've heard it somewhere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must first thank you.[A]
My clan was always fighting against
Bern and the clans that followed Bern.[A]
We were forced to reside to guerrila
warfare instead of going up against[A]
them face to face.[A]
However, now that you have attacked
Bern, the tables are beginning to[A]
tip in our favor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.
I am glad that I could help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I want to ask you one thing.[A]
Once this battle is over, do you
intend to withdraw your troops[A]
right away?[A]
[OpenMidRight]After this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
Sacae belongs to us Sacaean people.[A]
If authoritarian rule by Bern is only
to be replaced by Etrurian rule, then[A]
we would have to fight you next.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right after this battle...
That would not be possible.[A]
We must have Sacae as a base to
launch direct attacks on Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...
Directly into Bern's lands?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if we could drive off Bern now,
it would only be a matter of time[A]
until they strike back at us.[A]
We must destroy their roots.
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are right.
I see...[A]
In that case, I
shall aid you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That would help us tremendously.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But once Bern is defeated, you
must withdraw your troops from Sacae.[A]
Is that all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
You have my word.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, I need you to send this
letter to Bishop Yodel in Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A letter?
May I ask what it says?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's the story we heard from
Niime about the Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
What did you discuss
with her about the Dragons?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It'll get long if I tell you.[A]
I haven't sealed the letter yet so
you can look through it if you want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]All right.
Let me see...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157]...Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...We enter Bern now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
We will attack Bern very soon.[A]
So...may I ask the rest of[A]
story now?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...Yes.
That is why I came to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]King Zephiel was an outstanding pupil in
his studies, he was skilled in war craft...[A]
He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But still the former king
did not look kindly at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In fact...[A]
Our father began to hate Zephiel
because he grew to become such a[A]
brilliant and worthy youth.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...
is that supposed to mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father was a man of ordinary
skill and intellect.[A]
Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill
made our father cold towards him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Jealousy...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]And then one day, our father
told Zephiel that 'the next heir to[A]
Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'[A]

Men and Dragons once lived in harmony
on this land. However, that harmony
was broken when the men suddenly
started to invade. In a great war
known later as the Scouring, both
sides fought over dominion of the
continent. The laws of nature were
twisted from the vast amounts of
power that were released...
The Dragons were defeated and
disappeared from the face of continent.
Mankind then began to spread its
forces throughout to populate the land.
And now, 1000 years later...

Mankind then began to spread its

And now, 1000 years later...
[0A72]
The Scouring...
The great war between Dragons and men...[A]
[0A73]
The Dragons were defeated
and disappeared from Elibe...[A]
[0A74]
Mankind celebrated victory and then
spread their forces throughout the continent...[A]
[0A75]
1000 years have passed...[A]
[0A76]
The people of the continent Elibe have
been spreading technology and civilization[A]
for some time now, after the Dragons had
been defeated in the Scouring.[A]
[0A77]
In the west resides the kingdom of
Etruria, which has the highest level of[A]
civilization in Elibe.[A]
[0A78]
The Kingdom of Bern, with a powerful
military and a practical and pragmatic[A]
attitude about life, is located in the east.[A]
[0A79]
These are the two strongest nations in Elibe,
and the lesser nations are located between[A]
them.[A]
[0A7A]
There is the Lycian Alliance, which is under
joint relationship of various marquesses.[A]
[0A7B]
The people of the Knights Union of Ilia
are hard at work cultivating the snowy[A]
wastelands in the north.[A]
[0A7C]
In Sacae live various clans which ride
through the plains on horseback.[A]
[0A7D]
Although there were occasional clashes
between nation-states, there was a general[A]
sense of balance of power and peace in
Elibe.[A]
However, that balance was suddenly
disrupted...[A]
[0A7E]
King Zephiel, ruler of the Kingdom of Bern,
has sent his forces out to conquer the rest[A]
of Elibe.[A]
[0A7F]
Bern's forces invaded Sacae and Ilia and
mercilessly massacred all those who stood[A]
against them.[A]
And now, Bern has shown signs of invading
the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[0A80]
A youth named Roy was in Lycia's largest
territory, Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He was sent as a transfer student to train
to become the next Marquess of Pherae.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood, who has fallen ill,
has sent for Roy to return home.[A]
[0A81]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Just around that time Lilina, the[LoadOverworldFaces]
daughter of Hector, had traveled to Lycia[A]
to pay her respects to Eliwood.[A]
[0A82]
After getting the message, Roy hurried
back home, taking with him his loyal[A]
knights and [LoadOverworldFaces]Bors, a knight from Ostia
responsible for Lilina's safety.[A]

[0A83]
The story begins when Roy had reached an
area on the outskirts of Pherae...[A]
[0A84]

[0A85]

[0A86]

[0A87]

[0A88]

[0A89]

[0A8A]
There is a small village on the border
of Pherae and Bern.[A]
Here was where Roy was to meet the
[LoadOverworldFaces]mercenary band that Eliwood had hired[A]
for him.[A]
[0A8B]
Just east of the village is a small castle
occupied by Bern's forces.[A]
When Roy had reached the village,
the castle was in a chaotic state.[A]
Roy had yet to learn that the confusion
going on in the castle was going to[A]
cause turbulence all over Elibe...[A]
[0A8C]

[0A8D]

[0A8E]

[0A8F]
Just to the north of Pherae territory
stands Castle Araphen.[A]
The Lycia Alliance had gathered here to
discuss the matters of going up against[A]
Bern.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy[LoadOverworldFaces] and [LoadOverworldFaces]Guinevere were only half
a day away from Castle Araphen, when a[A]
messenger brought them news that they
could not believe.[A]
The message was this:[A]
"Bern has a trio of elite generals
called the Three Dragon Lords."[A]
[0A90]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Two of these three, General Brenya and
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Narshen, have attacked Castle[A]
Araphen and nearly decimated the Lycia
Alliance Army.[A]

[0A91]
Although the morale of the Pherae Army went
down severely, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy led his group towards[A]
Castle Araphen to find survivors and
check the damage.[A]
[0A92]

[0A93]

[0A94]

[0A95]

[0A96]

[0A97]

[0A98]
Respecting Hector's last wishes,
Roy made his way west toward Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On the way there,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy passes through the Laus territory,[A]
goverened by [LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Eric.[A]
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory
with vast meadows and clear streams,[A]
but there was great skullduggery
going on behind the scenes...[A]
[0A99]
Lord Eric, Marquess of Laus, had been
working with Bern against his allies[A]
of Lycia.[A]
This gave [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy further shock.[A]
Lycia, where Roy had grown up in, was
no longer a safe place to be either.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heading for Ostia, Roy decided to move
[LoadOverworldFaces]through the mountains where people[A]
seldom want to avoid unncessary trouble.[A]
[0A9A]

[0A9B]

[0A9C]

[0A9D]

[0A9E]

[0A9F]
After taking [LoadOverworldFaces]Saul, a priest of the
Elimine Church, and [LoadOverworldFaces]Dorothy, his[A]
bodyguard into their ranks, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy
and company crossed the mountains and[A]
entered the [LoadOverworldFaces]Thria lands, located to
the southeast of Ostia.[A]
Thria is governed by Lord Orun, a
half brother to Lord Hector.[A]
[0AA0]
Orun's home castle seemed to be a safe
place to stay for Roy.[A]

[0AA1]
However, Bern had its reach in the lands
of Thria as well...[A]
[0AA2]

[0AA3]

[0AA4]

[0AA5]
Hearing of the rebellion,
Roy hurried his pace towards Ostia.[A]
[0AA6]
According to the information that he had
gathered on the way, [LoadOverworldFaces]General Leygance,[A]
one of Lord Hector's advisors, had started
a rebellion with[LoadOverworldFaces] Lieutenant Devias to sell[A]
Ostia to Bern.[A]
[0AA7]
Lilina had been captured and taken hostage
by Leygance. She was then imprisoned inside[A]
Castle Ostia, because Leygance thought
that he could use her for something[A]
later on.[A]
[0AA8]
Hearing that report, Roy and company
entered Ostia in an effort to[A]
rescue Lilina.[A]
[0AA9]
Ostia, the largest and most active city in
Lycia, was to become a battlefield,[A]
stained with blood...[A]
[0AAA]

[0AAB]

[0AAC]

[0AAD]

[0AAE]
Ostia's military primarily consists of
soldiers in heavy defense gear,[A]
such as Armor Knights and Generals.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With them, Castle Ostia's defenses
have always been incredibly strong.[A]
For a long time now, the castle has been
rumored to be "unconquerable."[A]
However, that rumor was about to be
proven wrong.[A]
By [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy, who, ironically, wished
to protect the castle.[A]

[0AB5]

[0AB6]

[0AB7]
Roy vowed to protect Lilina forever.
However, with Bern coming full force at them,[A]
Roy's army wouldn't stand a chance.[A]
Therefore, they decided to try
and take the Divine Weapons before[A]
Bern got their hands on them.[A]
Lilina showed them to a cave

in the outskirts of Ostia,[A]
where the first Divine Weapon was hidden.[A]
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,
was going to be a major ordeal for Roy.[A]
[0AB8]

[0AB9]

[0ABA]
After driving off General Narshen from
Ostia, [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company braced themselves[A]
for further attacks from [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern.[A]
However, Bern's belligerent movement
towards Lycia suddenly stopped altogether,[A]
as if to mock Roy and his caution.[A]
Bern was also maintaining a neutral
position regarding the truce offer[A]
from Etruria.[A]
Bern's sudden silence and lack of
activity could only be described as eerie.[A]
[0ABB]
With Hector gone, Eliwood was now the
only lasting power in Lycia.[A]
Eliwood summoned the various marquesses to
Pherae to discuss their future actions.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It was decided that Eliwood was to
become the next leader of the Lycia Alliance[A]
and that a new Lycia Alliance Army would
be established.[A]
This new army's purpose was not to
take the offense against Bern, but[A]
rather take a defensive stance for Lycia.
For his victory against Bern in Ostia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy was chosen to be the leader of
the new Lycia Alliance army.[A]
[0ABC]
Slowly but surely, the people of Lycia
were starting to brighten up.[A]
Business was improving, and people's
attitudes started to get more optimistic.[A]
Around that time, Etruria called for Lycia's
assistance in ridding the [LoadOverworldFaces]Western Isles of
the outlaws and bandits making their base[A]
base there.[A]
[0ABD]
Lycia's citizens expressed their discontent
by saying that they saw no reason in sending[A]
troops all the way to the Western Isles, but
because Lycia needed Etruria's protection[A]
against Bern, they had no choice but to
oblige.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Thus, Roy and the Lycia Alliance Army
passed through Etruria and made their way[A]
towards the Western Isles.[A]
[0ABE]
The Western Isles are the various
islands off the western coast of Elibe.[A]
Currently, they are colonies of Etruria.
The Western Isles are rich in minerals[A]
and natural resources, so mining[A]
is a major industry. However, these
minerals are worth a fortune,[A]
so various [LoadOverworldFaces]rogue groups have traveled
there hoping to loot the mines[A]
and sell the minerals for themselves.[A]
Thus, the people living on the Western Isles
spend their days in constant fear[A]
of bandit attacks.[A]
And Roy had been sent
to defeat these bandits.[A]

[0ABF]
Roy accompanied Cecilia to the
Etrurian capital of Aquleia.[A]
[0AC0]
After debating about Roy and Guinevere's
Position, the Etrurian Court decided[A]
[0AC1]
that they had no reason to attack Bern
when they hadn't suffered a direct[A]
offense.[A]
[0AC2]
Guinevere was to stay under Etrurian
Protection at Aquleia, and the Lycia[A]
Alliance Army was to be an independant
[0AC3]
squad under the Etrurian Military.
To test his worth, Etruria sent Roy[A]
[0AC4]
to the Western Isles, where his
mission was to rid the islands[A]
[0AC5]
of bandits there. The Western
Isles is an archipelago under[A]
[0AC6]
Etrurian protection lying to the west
Of the mainland. Many mining[A]
[0AC7]
corporations have sprouted up, trying
to monopolize the rich minerals that[A]
[0AC8]
lie in the islands' soils. However,
the riches attracted many bandits,[A]
[0AC9]
and the people lived in
constant fear of them...[A]
[0ACA]
3 seperate islandsア Fibernia,[LoadOverworldFaces][A]
[0ACB]
Caledonia,[LoadOverworldFaces][A]
[0ACC]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and Dia.[A]
All of these islands are rich
in mineral resources,[A]
and mining has become a large industry.[A]
The largest mine is located in
[LoadOverworldFaces]Mt. Ebrakhm, in the north of Fibernia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy turned his forces towards
Ebrakhm hoping to gather some information
[A]on the bandits.[A]

[0ACD]
To get to Mt. Ebrakhm, one must go
past the castle that is located in [A]
Ebrakhm valley.[A]
Therefore, Roy sent a messenger to [LoadOverworldFaces]Nord,[A]
the castle owner, to be granted permission
to pass through his lands.[A]
Since Roy and company were there because
of an official request from Etruria,[A]
they didn't think that gaining Nord's[A]
support would be as difficult.[A]
[0ACE]
Roy couldn't believe Lalum's story.[A]
He quickly penned off a letter to [LoadOverworldFaces]Cecilia
letting her know of the horrors happening[A]
on the Western Isles.[A]
He also let her know of the actions that he[A]
planned to take from now on.[A]

After sending the letter, Roy and
company moved towards the mine in[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Mt. Ebrakhm to try and rescue the people[A]
[0ACF]
suffering from forced labor.[A]
Etruria had assigned [LoadOverworldFaces]Bishop Oro
of the Elimine Church to supervise[A]
the mine.[A]
Already a large amount of minerals had been
taken, but it seemed they wanted more..[A]
[0AD0]
Ebrakhm... known now as the Mine of Death.[A]
The wails of the people forced into labor
there echo through the mines, like[A]
the howling of ghosts...[A]
[0AD1]

[0AD2]

[0AD3]

[0AD4]
In order to get some information from
the resistance forces about the bandits[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]on the Western Isles, Roy and company
moved west along the coastline.[A]

[0AD5]
Along the way, they came across[A]
a small village caught in constant
conflict between the resistance group[A]
and the landowner trying to get
rid of them.[A]
[0AD6]

[0AD7]

[0AD8]
The Lycia Alliance Army took Elphin as
a tactician.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following his advice, they moved south[A]
toward the isle of Caledonia.
Caledonia is one of the main islands[A]
that make up the Western Isles.
The other two are Fibernia and Dhia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Castle Idina is located on Caledonia. Here,
men from all over the world are rounded up[A]
[0AD9]
and locked in prison cells to be taken
to Mt. Ebrakhm, to the Mines of Death.[A]
[0ADA]
When Roy arrived at Castle Idina,
the situation already looked dire...[A]
[0ADB]

[0ADC]
To rescue the people of the Western Isles,[A]
Roy headed for Djuto, the Isle's largest
city and its capital.[A]

[0ADD]
According to Elphin, Lord Arcard, who was
in charge of supervising the Western Isles,[A]
was an Etrurian of high nobility, but not
of high importance to the Etrurian[A]
government.[A]

[0ADE]
Roy was still worried about Etruria's response
to his attacking the capital,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]but to rescue the people, he had
to get rid of Arcard as soon as possible.[A]
[0ADF]

[0AE0]

[0AE1]

[0AE2]

[0AE3]

[0AE4]
Following Elphin's lead, Roy
headed for the cave near Djuto[A]
to obtaian the Divine Weapon.

[0AE5]
But Roy and company weren't the[A]
only ones who knew of the cave.[A]
Yet another battle was awaiting them...[A]

[0AE6]

[0AE7]

[0AE8]
The coup d'etat at Aquleia quickly
spread out to the rest of Etruria.[A]

[0AE9]
Cecilia escaped with Guinevere from Aquleia.
She also formed an Anti-Coup d'etat[A]
group and traveled around Etruria
fighting the rebel forces.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the rebel forces had Bern on
their side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]King Mordred had been taken hostage,[A]
which led [LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]"Great General" Douglas and[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]"Knight General" Percival to be forced onto
the rebels' side. With these powerful[A]
forces on their side, the rebels
gradually began to push the[A]
Anti-Coup d'etat group of of Etruria.[A] 
[0AEA]
The Anti-Coup d'etat forces had been
driven into an old castle on the island[A]
of [LoadOverworldFaces]Misul to the west of Etruria.[A]
[0AEB]
Roy had learned that Cecilia had been
forced back by the Coup d'etat.[A]
[0AEC]
In response, Roy headed for Misul.[A]
[0AED]
Meanwhile, the Anti-Coup d'etat group
was under attack by a joint force of[A]
Coup d'etat forces and Bern's troops.[A]
It would only be a matter of time before
the Anti-Coup d'etat forces were defeated...[A]
[0AEE]

[0AEF]

[0AF0]

[0AF1]

[0AF2]

[0AF3]
After rescuing Guinevere and Cecilia, Roy
headed towards the Nabata desert, following[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Sophia's lead.[A]

[0AF4]
According to Sophia, there was a
hidden oasis in the desert,[A]
and that's where her village, Arcadia,
was located.[A]
However, at that time, Arcadia was
under attack by Bern's forces.[A]
Their aim may be the Dragons
that are said to inhabit the village.[A]

[0AF5]
Although the Lycia Alliance Army moved
as quickly as they could towards Arcadia,[A]
a vicious sandstorm stood in their way.[A]
[0AF6]
In the hidden village, Arcadia,
stands an ancient temple.[A]
One of the divine weapons
is said to be hidden in it.[A]
Roy and company were quick to
follow Bern's troops,[A]
who had already found their way
into the temple...[A]
[0AF7]

[0AF8]

[0AF9]

[0AFA]
After saving the hidden vilage of Arcadia,
Roy's army found their way out of[A]
the desert, following Igrene's lead.
Now, they turned toward Etruria[LoadOverworldFaces]to confront[A]

[0AFB]
the Coup d'etat forces. At this point, a[A]
a disturbing message came from
the Elder of Arcadia.[A]

[0AFC]
Apparently, Fa, the little Dragon girl, had
left Arcadia, following Roy. If she were to[A]
fall into the hands of the Coup d'etat
forces or of Bern, who stood behind them,[A]
it would be a disaster.[A]

[0AFD]
Bent on finding Fa, Roy moved his[A]
forces toward a small fort
near the Etrurian border.[A]
[0AFE]

[0AFF]

[0B00]
After rescuing Fa,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy headed for Aquleia.[A]

[0B01]
The capital of Etruria,[A]
Aquleia is also the largest,
most prosperous city on the continent.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Preparing for the Lycia Alliance Army's
attack, the Coup d'etat army concentrated[A]
forces in Aquleia. Originally they had
planned on using the garrison of the city[A]
for defense, but since the [LoadOverworldFaces]Elimine Church
had turned to Roy's side, the Coup d'etat[A]
Army had no choice but to retreat to the
castle and take post there instead for fear[A]
that the Church may have encouraged the
city denizens to protest.[A]
[0B02]
The Elimine Church was started by "Saint
Elimine, one of the Eight Heroes. This[A]
religious organization had many followers,
primarily in [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern and Etruria.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy had gained the Church's support
in attacking Aquleia.[A]
However, [LoadOverworldFaces]Narshen and his elite troops[A]
were waiting for Roy inside the castle.[A]

[0B03]

[0B04]

[0B05]

[0B06]

[0B07]

[0B08]

[0B09]
At the request of King Mordred, Roy
headed for the Tower of the Saint on[A]
the outskirts of Aquleia.
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Tower of the Saint was a place of[A]
worship for Saint Elimine, one of the
Eight Heroes, and in the tower lay[A]
various holy object relating to her.[A]
However, this sacred tower was now
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]under the control of Bishop Windam,[A]
who had rebelled against the Elimine
Church by Roartz's orders.[A]
[0B0A]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
forces flocked to Anti Coup d'etat group,[A]
forcing out the Coup d'etat Militia.
Roartz and Arcard were driven out of[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Etruria and fled [LoadOverworldFaces]north to Ilia, [LoadOverworldFaces]
which was under Bern's control.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ilia, or the Frozen Highlands, is a
land with short summers and long winters.[A]
[0B0B]
With little arable land, the
nation's main source of income[A]
was sending mercenaries out to
fight for pay.[A]
[0B0C]
The now free Kingdom of Etruria
joined its forces with the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
Now a joint force under the name of the[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Etrurian Army, their first mission was[A]
to enter Ilia to finish off the Coup d'etat
Forces. After that, they would launch direct[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]attacks on Bern. [LoadOverworldFaces]Roy, nominated as leader of
of the Etrurian Army, had[A]
the powerful support of the
Elimine Church, getting the[A]
people on his side.[A]

[0B0D]
However, Roy had to face the freezing
cold of Ilia, as well as the[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]elite troops under General Murdock,[A]
the leader of the 3 Dragon Lords.
In addition, some of the powerful[A]
Ilian Knights had turned to Bern's side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As a start, Roy headed for Castle
Raemy, located on the Ilian border.[A]
[0B0E]

[0B0F]

[0B10]

[0B11]

[0B12]

[0B13]

[0B14]

[0B15]

[0B16]

[0B17]
After defeating Arcard, Roy moved
east deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Soon, they entered the thick forests
that characterize Ilia's central land.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, a general of Bern,
Bishop Martel, was waiting for them[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]with an ancient spell that was
said to have been lost centuries ago...[A]

[0B18]

[0B19]

[0B1A]

[0B1B]

[0B1C]

[0B1D]
After defeating Martel and making it
through the forest,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company faced the blizzards that
are common of Ilia's winters.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ilia's harsh weather has been a natural
defense in itself against invaders.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Coupled with Ilia's greatest natural weapon,
Sigune, captain of the Pegasus Knight[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Squad that had turned to Bern, was
preparing to attack Roy.[A]
[0B1E]

[0B1F]

[0B20]

[0B21]

[0B22]
After defeating Sigune,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy headed for Edessa,[A]
located in the northeast of Ilia.[A]
[0B23]
Castle Edessa, owned by [LoadOverworldFaces]Zealot, leader of
the Ilian Mercenary knights, once served as[A]
headquarters of the Pegasus Knight teams[A]
as well.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, with Zealot gone, Bern saw its
chance and attacked the castle, forcing[A]
the Mercenary and Pegasus Knights into
submission.[A]
Castle Edessa was [LoadOverworldFaces]Murdock's headquarters,[A]
but since Murdock had returned to Bern,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Roartz was put in charge.[A]
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's
speed in advancing to Edessa,[A]
Roartz hurriedly contacted the
various Ilian knight groups asking[A]
them for aid.
However, their replies were not promising.[A]
[0B24]

[0B25]

[0B26]

[0B27]

[0B28]

[0B29]

[0B2A]
After taking back Castle Eldessa,
Roy turned his troops toward the ancient ruins[A]
located on the outskirts of the town.
There is a high chance that a[A]
Divine Weapon is hidden there.[A]

[0B2B]

[0B2C]

[0B2D]

[0B2E]
After Roy captured Aquleia, other Etrurian
powers slowly began to change their[A]
views and express their anti Coup d'etat
opinions. Driven away from their palace,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roartz [LoadOverworldFaces]and Arcard fled to[LoadOverworldFaces]
Sacae, which was still under Bern's control.[A]

[0B2F]
Sacae is the vast plain-covered
land in the center of the continent.[A]
Before Bern invaded, the various tribes
there led nomadic lives.[A]
[0B30]
The Etrurian army joined the Lycia Alliance
Army to form a joint Etruria-Lycia[A]
Union army. The decision was to head
[LoadOverworldFaces]for Sacae to get rid of the remaining[A]
Coup d'etat forces and also attack [LoadOverworldFaces]Bern,
who was behind them.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Thinking that some Etrurian knight
groups would not approve of being seen[A]
under the Lycia Alliance Army, Roy
oficially named the new Union the[A]
"Etrurian Army" and became its commander.[A]
Roy led the division responsible[A]
for entering Sacae.[A]
[0B31]
The Sacae people are wary of outsiders
in the first place, but even worse,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Brenya,[A]
another one of the Three Dragon Lords,
had gotten the largest tribe in Sacae,[A]
the Djute clan, under submission.
[LoadOverworldFaces]The warriors of the Djute tribe[A]
and Brenya's elite Bern troops stood in
front of Roy as he set foot on Sacae's soil.[A]

[0B32]

[0B33]

[0B34]

[0B35]

[0B36]

[0B37]

[0B38]

[0B39]

[0B3A]

[0B3B]
After defeating Arcard, Roy crossed
the border and [LoadOverworldFaces]entered the land of Sacae.[A]
After Bern invaded, the Djute clan,[A]
the most powerful clan in Sacae, became[A]
its servant. Most of those clans
who stood up against the two joint[A]
forces had already been
decimated.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Although the "Silver Wolf" Dayan,
the leader of the Kutolah clan,[A]
had been retaliating with guerilla
tactics, the situation was dire.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Sacae had basically become
a territory of Bern.[A]
Now, as Roy set foot on the plains
of Sacae, the warriors of the [LoadOverworldFaces]Djute[A]
clan stood in his path.[A] 
[0B3C]

[0B3D]

[0B3E]

[0B3F]

[0B40]

[0B41]

[0B42]

[0B43]
After defeating the Djute Tribe, Roy moved
[LoadOverworldFaces]toward Bulgar, the largest city in Sacae.[A]
[0B44]
As a center of commerce between Etruria,
Bern, and Ilia, Bulgar has had a history[A]
of being a free city without a rule.
However, with Bern's invasion,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Advisor Roartz now had control of[A]
Bulgar under Bern's protection.[A]
[0B45]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy approached Bulgar to liberate it and to
gain some useful information on invading Bern.[A]
[0B46]

[0B47]

[0B48]
After meeting Niime, the "Hermit on
the Mountain", the mysteries of Bern's[A]
Dragons were slowly beginning to unfold.[A]
With more unknowns still needing verification,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy directed his troops towards a large[A]
manor on the outskirts of Bulgar.[A]
[0B49]
There, Advisor Roartz of Etruria[A]
was preparing his defenses against Roy...[A]
[0B4A]

[0B4B]
Roy headed towards the ruins in Sacae,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]after the Divine Weapon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the remaining forces of the
Djute clan were waiting for Roy in the ruins...[A] 
[0B4C]

[0B4D]

[0B4E]
After surviving many hardships,
Roy finally set foot on Bern's soil.[A]
[0B4F]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guinevere guided Roy toward the[A]
Temple of Seals, but in their path
stood Bern's elite troops,[A]
the strongest army on the continent,
led by [LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Murdock, the smartest[A]
and strongest general in Bern.[A]
[0B50]
Etruria and Bern, the two leading
forces on the continent, out for[A]
all-out war. The longest and bloodiest day
yet to be seen by Elibe was about to begin...[A]
[0B51]

[0B52]

[0B53]

[0B54]
Roy ventured deep inside the Temple 
of Seals.[A]
Apparently, there was something else
hidden there other than the Sword of[A]
Seals.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, [LoadOverworldFaces]  Pereth, once of Murdock's best
troops leaders, was already inside[A]
the temple and waiting to attack Roy.[A]
[0B55]

[0B56]

[0B57]
After obtaining the Sword of Seals,
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy directed his troops towards Bern's[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]capital, where King Zephiel was waiting.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Inside the castle, Zephiel awaited with[A]
his personal guards at hand.[A]

[0B58]
Roy prepared to charge the castle
to end this war, and to bring[A]
peace to Elibe again...[A]
[0B59]

[0B5A]
 
[0B5B]

[0B5C]
Bern surrendered with King Zephiel's death.
The great war that shook the lands of Elibe[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]was over.
However, Roy's battle was not.[A]
[0B5D]
Roy continued to search for the Dark
Priestess, who could be the Dark Dragon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following the light emitted by the Divine
Weapons, Roy headed for the Dragon Temple.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, waiting for Roy in front of the
[LoadOverworldFaces]temple was Brenya, the one remaining[A]
Dragon Lord of Bern. She had rounded up the
remaining troops and was waiting[A]
to attack Roy.[A]
[0B5E]
A battle with the now dead Kingdom of Bern...[A]
Roy already had a heavy heart at[A]
having to battle these "ghosts".[A]
[0B5F]

[0B60]
lcaring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Yuno was pretty worried about
you and Thany.[A]
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Yuno,
she's a worrier.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I understand.[A]
Our sister was often too soft
on Thany and me.[A]
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.[A]
Yuno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and[A]
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's Yuno.[A]
[0B61]

[0B62]

[0B63]

[0B64]

[0B65]

[0B66]
After defeating Bern's remaining
troops, Roy entered the Dragon Temple.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He searched for the Dark
Priestess to prevent the same[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]tragedy as the Dragon Human[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]wars from happening again.[A]

[0B67]
Here in the temple, Roy was to
learn the truth of the legends he had[A]
always heard. What Roy was about to hear
was completely different from what[A]
he had always believed to be true...[A]

[0B68]

[0B69]

[0B6A]

[0B6B]
Here in Lycia, Roy, the young heir[A]
[0B6C]
of Pherae, was studying in the great city[A]
[0B6D]
of Ostia to train himself for his
position. Today, his teacher,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Cecilia of Etruria, is
instructing him on battle tactics...[A]

One thousand years after the great
war between Dragons and men known
as the Scouring...
[.....] 
[0BCE]
Mankind was beginning to
prosper once more.[.....] 
[0BCF]
However, a sudden invasion from
the east threw the continent
into war again.[.....] 
[0BD0]
Those who started the war...
Those who suffered...
Those who stood up...[.....] 
[0BD1]
Countless people fought to the
death to protect what they
believed in.[.....] 
[0BD2]
This is a story of a group of
heroes who withstood the test
of time during this age of suffering...[.....] 
[0BD3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CB][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]B-Boss!
An army's invading our cave![A]
[OpenMidRight]What![A]
How many of them are there?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dunno, Boss.
I hope there aren't too many of them...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's strange...[A]
The Lycia marquesses should be having
bigger problems than dealing with[A]
bandits like us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well?[A]
What do we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]They probably don't know much about
this cave, anyway.[A]
Just lure them into stepping on the
floor tiles where hot lava spurts[A]
up and get rid of 'em.[A]
[0BD4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, over here![A]
The Divine Weapon is located on
the other side of this lava pit.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]Lilina, are you all right?[A]
Have you calmed down?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[ToggleSmile]maybe I'm not fully all right,
but now isn't the time to be sad.[A]
I need to protect Ostia,
like my father before me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right...
[ToggleSmile]Good for you, Lilina.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm okay because you're
with me, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Did you just say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
Anyway, I'll tell you what I know
about this Divine Weapon.[A]
The one here is the sword that was used
by Roland, one of the 'Eight Heroes.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That Roland... is that King Roland,
the first king of Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, he's our ancestor.[A]
This sword is called 'The Blazing Sword,'
or the Durandal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Durandal...the name has a
strange echo to it.[A]
So Roland used the Durandal to fight
the Dragons during the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's how the legend goes.[A]
They also say that after the war ended,
Roland returned to his hometown of Ostia.[A]
He raised the Durandal high above his head,
and the land that had become barren after[A]
the war suddenly became lush with
vegetation and life again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... that must be some sword.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, it's a weapon that can defeat Dragons.
It must have some special powers in it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
...Oh yeah, I heard that a group
of bandits has made its base here.[A]
Is it going to be all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
Is what going to be all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I mean, there's always the chance that
they have might have taken the Durandal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, don't worry.[A]
Only those who are Roland's successors know
how to remove the Durandal from its sheath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, okay.
Then everything's fine.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All we have to do is get rid of
the bandits and obtain the Durandal.[A]
[0BD5]
[LoadFace][0x1CB]Sigh.[A]
What are you guys doing in a
place like this?[A]
Oh well, but since you're
already here...[A]
I can't let you guys go,
can I?[A]
[0BD6]
[LoadFace][0x1CB][ToggleSmile]Crap...[A]
I knew this would happen...[A]
[0BD7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][ToggleSmile]Roy!
Here it is![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]So this is the Durandal...
It's a very large sword.[A]
I don't think many of us are
going to be able to swing it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But history has it that Roland
was a small man.[A]
I think it's the person skill in the
sword that determines whether or not[A]
he can use.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then if I become better with my
sword, I can use it as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well... maybe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe?[A]
Come on...at least say 'probably.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hee hee![A]
[0BD8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, here it is!
There was a sword under the altar.[A]
It was a task to get it out,
but we have it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]This is the Durandal...[A]
But was it worth losing Lilina...?[A]
[0BD9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D3][ToggleSmile]So this is the end of the caaave?[A]
Treeaasure...
Where are you...[A]
Answer meee...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150]
Boss... you sure about this?[A]
Bern told us to block the entrance
to the cave.[A]
If they catch us now, we'll be
sent back to prison![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Idiooot![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]We're gonna bury this cave
anywaaay...[A]
Sooo they ain't gonna know that we
took the treeaasure...[A]
If we bury the cave without taking the
treasure, no one's ever going to be[A]
able to fiiind it...[A]
Have ya ever thought about how the
treasure would feel theeen![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Well...
'Guess you're right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151]Boss![A]
There's an army stationed outside
the cave![A]
[OpenRight]Whaaat?[A]
So they think they're going to take
our treasure, do they?[A]
Have the boys near the entrance take
take them ooouut...[A]
And grab all the treasure chests...[A]
They're mine nooowww![A]
[0BDA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]A Divine Weapon lies in this cave...[A][Clear]
It's pretty dark in here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]According to a scholar in Djuto,
if there is a Divine Weapon in here,[A]
it would most surely be the Armads,
the 'Axe of Lightning'.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Armads...[A]
An axe, not a sword this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Armads was used by 'Durban the
Berserker', the largest and most[A]
muscular of the Eight Heroes.[A]
A blow from his axe must have
been quite a sight to see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Elphin, you certainly know a lot about
the Eight Heroes and the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a bard.
I know lots of myths and legends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
I want to hear them, when we have
the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
...Master Roy, it seems we have
company in this cave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are also some strange
fumes coming out of the cave walls.[A]
We must proceed with caution.[A]
[0BDB]
[LoadFace][0x1D3]Daaaahhhhhh![A][Clear]
Rah![A]
[0BDC]
[LoadFace][0x1D3]Guh...[A]
[0BDD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Where is the Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[A]
I can hear wind coming from behind
the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
I can't hear it...[A]
[MoveRight]There's a niche... between the
floor and wall.[A][Clear]
Oh!
It opened![A][Clear]
...So this is the Divine Weapon?
That axe is huge.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Armads...[A]
So this is what Durban the Berserker
used.[A]
It certainly seems fit for a
mighty warrior.[A]
[0BDE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, here it is![A]
There's a large axe behind the
throne![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]This is the Armads...[A]
Durban's Axe...[A]
[0BDF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C6][ToggleSmile]Haven't you found the
Divine Weapon yet![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, we think it is lying inside
this altar, but it won't open...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Break it, force it open, or
do whatever![A]
We do not have much time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]But we must also deal with the
enemies that have entered the Temple![A]
We don't have enough manpower to
use force on the altar![A]
[OpenRight]Then we must get rid of
the enemy first.[A]
Then we can examine the altar
with leisure.[A]
[0BE0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the underground of
the desert?[A]
There's so much... water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D]This is close to a large source of
groundwater...[A]
That's why plants and animals can
live here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
So that's why you were able to build a
village here.[A]
Still, how did you find such a convenient
place like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Athos...[A]
The "Archsage" Athos is
the one who led us here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Do you mean the Athos of the
Eight Heroes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
After the Scouring...
Master Athos traveled around Elibe...[A]
At the end of his journey, he arrived at
a village in which people and Dragons[A]
lived together...[A]
But he said that... it would only be
a matter of time before it was found[A]
by other people...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So he led you here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... and he hid his
Divine Weapon inside this Temple...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And...
Can we use his Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Master Athos said that we were to
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...[A]
And if you use it...
it would be to protect us...[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Some of the pathways of this temple
will suddenly sink into the water...[A]
Please be careful...[A]
[0BE1]
[LoadFace][0x1C6]I...wasn't expecting you to
fight so well against all of us.[A]
[0BE2]
[LoadFace][0x1C6]Where... did you learn...
to fight... like this...?[A]
[0BE3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is here...
Inside this altar...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]...[A][Clear]
It won't open...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This altar is made... so that
only those of the village may[A]
open it...[A]
So please allow me...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]There...
There is the Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The one that Athos used?
Then...[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes...[A]
The "Infernal Element," Forblaze...[A]
[0BE4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think the book is inside the
altar, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you get it out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I sent some people to ask the
villagers about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
But don't force them.[A]
If they don't want to give it
to us, then we'll leave it here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A][ClearFace]
[0BE5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
The villagers helped us remove the book
from the altar![A]
Here it is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]
...If the Archsage Athos hid it,
it must be the Forblaze, the[A][Clear]
'Infernal Element'[A]
The legends say that no one
could escape its fiery wrath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We must be cautious with it.[A]
[0BE6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1D5][ToggleSmile]Lord Roartz fled!?[A]
Then what would happen to me, who turned
against the Church and took over this[A]
tower?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir, Lord Roartz's message is that he
'Doesn't want to waste time dealing[A]
with useless bishops who cannot even
tame the Elimine Church.'[A][OpenMidRight]That is because that damned Yodel
got in my way...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well yes...
But even if you tell me about it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...All right, fine...
Then this is our last mission.[A]
If we are to die, then the Lycia
Alliance Army is going down with us![A]
Prepare the 'Heavenly Arrows'![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please wait![A]
If we use that, it will hit our
allies as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Quiet!
I do the ordering around here![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...I shall show them...
Hehehe...![A]
[0BE7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]This is the Tower of the Saint.[A]
Saint Elimine's Weapon, the Aureola
Spell book, lies here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Lord Douglas.[A]
You are helping us, who were your
enemies just a while earlier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not have to thank me.[A]
The king ordered me to help you.
Do not worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Besides, you are saviors of Etruria.[A]
It is an honor to be able to fight[A]
alongside you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Master Roy,
I think we found the spell book.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Douglas,
is this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A]Yes, this is it.[A]
This is the 'Pinnacle of Light,' the
Aureola spell book, Saint Elimine's[A]
weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]May we use it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The king said to use anything in
the tower that you found useful.[A]
And the Elimine Church is on our
side as well.[A]
If we still have trouble, then I can
negotiate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Thank you, Lord Douglas.[A]
[0BEC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, I think we
have found the spellbook.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...This must be the Aureola,
the 'Pinnacle of Light.'[A]
Merlinus,[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to give this to
the Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
But the king said we could use anything
we found in the tower.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is the spell book their
saint used.[A]
It would be disrespectful to take it
Without their permission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]About the Aureola...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes.[A]
I will return it to the church
immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please don't.
We want you to take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What Saint Elimine truly wished
for was peace.[A]
Please take it and end this war.[A]

troops and our troops one after another![A]
We do not have a high chance of winning...![A]

[OpenMidRight]Hanon...[A]
She and Saint Elimine were the only
two women among the Eight Heroes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Watch your back.[A]
The Djute will give us everything they've
got to avenge their clansmen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, we have to be careful.
Let's go![A]
[0BFA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The Divine Weapon lies here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight]Elphin do you know about this
place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All I know is that the Divine Warrior
Hanon's bow, the Miurgre or the 'Bow[A]
of Winds' is kept here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hanon...[A]
She and Saint Elimine were the only
two women among the Eight Heroes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Watch your back.[A]
The Djute will give us everything they've

[OpenMidRight]All right, we have to be careful.
Let's go![A]
[0BFB]

[0BFC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1CE]They fell into the trap!
Get them now![A]
[0BFD]
[LoadFace][0x1CE]Feel the wrath of the
Djute's bond![A]
[0BFE]
[LoadFace][0x1CE]My brothers will
surely avenge me...[A]
[0BFF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]It's here![A]
The bow is hidden in the altar![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]This is the Miurgre...[A]
It looks like an ordinary bow,
but it must have incredible force.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Master Roy, Bern's troops are
retreating.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh.[A]
All right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right?
We must attack them now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, don't.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]They are fleeing.
They have no more will to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]They have families as well.[A]
There's no need to fight
more than necessary.[A]
[0C00]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C7][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight]So the battle above ground was
lost...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have liked to be at Lord
Murdock's side when he fell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We share your feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]However, we have an important mission
given from Lord Murdock.[A]
We must defend this Divine Weapon.[A]
The Silencing Darkness, Apocalypse,
must not get into the enemy hands![A]
[0C01]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]There is a Divine Weapon under here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]
I have only heard rumors within the army,
but apparently there is a spell book here[A]
that was placed to protect the Temple of
Seals from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]This place is guarded by Bern's troops
as well.[A]
It is highly probable that the spell book
that she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
We're going up against Zephiel soon.[A]
...I want to have as many weapons as
possible before we enter the castle.[A]
We have to get that book.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E]I have also heard rumors that there are
traps all over the underground level.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Apparently they are so well-crafted
that we could not possibly find a[A]
trap before it is set off.[A]
Perhaps thieves would be better at
finding traps...[A]
Anyway, please be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Let's be wary.[A]
[0C02]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]There is a Divine Weapon under here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]

[0C03]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere,
is this where the Divine Weapon is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably...[A]
I only have heard rumors that a spell
book here was placed to protect the[A]
Temple of Seals from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]This place is guarded by
Bern's troops as well.[A]
It is highly probable that the spell
book she speaks of is a Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]

I want to have as many weapons
as possible before we enter the castle.[A]
We have to get that book.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157]I also understand there are numerous
traps placed in the underground level.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
They are so well designed that it would
be impossible for us to find them.[A]
Perhaps thieves would be better at
finding them...[A]
Please be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Princess.
We will be careful.[A]
[0C04]
[LoadFace][0x1C7]
Darkness from an age
long forgotten...[A][Clear]
I will show you its power.[A]
[0C05]
[LoadFace][0x1C7]
[ToggleSmile]Dark...[A]
It is getting so dark...[A]
[0C06]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin, do you know what this
spell book is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is probably the Apocalypse
spell book.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apocalypse?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is also known as the
Silencing Darkness.[A]
Bramimond... the most mysterious
of the Eight Heroes, used it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Brammimond...[A]
I only know his name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We don't even know if Bramimond
is male or female, old or young.[A]
None of the old scrolls say
anything specific about Bramimond.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x157][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I was just thinking.[A]
[OpenLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering why there is always some
kind of trap where a Divine Weapon lies.[A][OpenLeft]...Perhaps it is to warn people that their
power is too great to be dealt with lightly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But still...
The traps are so carefully set.[A][Clear]
There must be other reasons.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]
...I wondered about the same thing.[A]
Perhaps I shall look into it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Please.[A]
