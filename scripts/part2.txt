[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Big Sister Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thany?
Why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I've been in the Etrurian Army.[A]
I was surprised when I heard that
Edessa got taken by Bern,[A]
but I knew you'd be okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Oh?
And why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were captain of the Fleet!
There's no way Bern could defeat you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]
Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]But I won't stay defeated by
Bern for long.
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,[A]
but if I joined you, I could[A]
fight Bern as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then are you going to
fight with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Really? Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does that make you
so excited?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]
I became a Pegasus Knight because
I wanted to be like you.[A]
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My my...[A]
Well, you always did tend to
go overboard with things...[A]

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yuno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Tate...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a long story...[A]
But anyway,
I'm with the Etrurian Army now.[A]
I heard that Edessa had fallen to
Bern, and I was worried, but...[A]
I'm glad to see that you are
still all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... I thought you were originally[A]
fighting for the army that was
fighting against this Etrurian Army.[A][Clear]
You didn't...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
I didn't go against the Ilian
Mercenary Code.[A]
I fulfilled my duties as a
mercenary, and then joined the[A]
Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course...[A]
You're a good and diligent girl.
You wouldn't do something like that.[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's all right...[A]
And um...
What are you wearing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[A]
Why, this is my Military
Outfit, as you very well know.[A]
Well,
what do you think?[A]
Don't you think I can still go on
as Pegasus Knight Fleet Captain?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]But I thought
you retired.[A][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I can't be saying that in this
time of emergency![A]
On my own all I could do was
rescue the people in the castle,[A]
but if I joined you, I could fight
against Bern as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So you're going
to fight alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes![A]
I never thought I could fight
alongside you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't get cocky now.
I haven't gotten too rusty yet either![A]

You're not hurt?[A]
They didn't do anything
terrible to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh Zealot, I am no child.[A]
I am the ex-captain of the
Pegasus Knight Fleet, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That's true,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm all right.
I'm not hurt or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?[A]
I thought you were with
the Lycia Alliance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well,
it's a long story...[A]
Anyways, this is the Etrurian Army
only by name.[A]
It is actually made up of troops
From the Lycia Alliance Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Oh... I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
I couldn't be at the castle
when I was needed the most...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no point in
dwelling on the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But you had to go
out and fight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh?
Don't you like my Fleet Captain outfit?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Of course!
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then there is no problem.[A]
You'll be seeing a
lot more of it from now on...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What!
Do you mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]I will fight alongside you as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No! No no no.
You retired long ago.[A]
So just leave the fighting
to us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even after I retired,
I had to fight anyway.[A]
Zealot, there is no safe
place in the world anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]So I will fight,[A]
so I can help bring a time of
peace all the more quickly.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Next is Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][CloseSpeechFast]Master Roy![A]
Part of Bern's army is hiding in the
ruins on the outskirts of Edessa![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ruins?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. They say that in it[A]
lies a spear that was used
during the Dragon Human wars.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][FastPrint]What! That spear...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is most probably a Divine Weapon.[A]
[OpenRight]We must hurry to the ruins![A]
[01AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinevere,
we will attack Bern now.[A]
So may I ask...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... The rest of the story.[A]
[OpenMidRight]King Zephiel was an outstanding pupil in
his studies, he was skilled in war craft...[A]
He grew to be the perfect heir for the king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]But still the former king
did not look kindly at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In fact...[A]
Our father began to hate Zephiel
because he grew to become such a[A]
brilliant and worthy youth.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...
is that supposed to mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father was a man of ordinary
skill and intellect.[A]
Therefore, Zephiel's outstanding skill
made our father cold towards him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Jealousy...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]And then one day, our father
told Zephiel that 'the next heir to[A]
Bern would be Guinevere's husband.'[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What!
That's awful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel was very patient.[A]
He said that he did not mind even if
he did not gain the throne.[A]
But the people around us, who were
looking forward to Zephiel's ability[A]
to be a good king, would not allow
anyone else to be the heir.[A]
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Decided to kill King Zephiel...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a banquet, our father gave Zephiel
a poisoned drink from his own hands.[A]
And that was the first and last cup
that Zephiel ever took from our father.[A]
After returning to his room, Zephiel
started to get sick.[A]
For 10 days and nights, Zephiel lingered
between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]... The former king never did
anything after that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
But I have heard that he had plans
to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel's[A]
mother as traitors.[A]
He was scheming to murder them all
along with Zephiel.[A]
After hearing that, Zephiel made
believe he was dead.[A]
Our father then checked the coffin to
confirm Zephiel's death.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Good. Thank you.[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x136]
[OpenMidRight]Gale. So it begins.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, my Lord.
We are ready as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your squad will be the key to
winning the battle.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Of course, my Lord.
I will not let you down.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
We will show them the power of Bern's
[ToggleSmile]main frontline army.[A]
Still... that general from the
Lycia Alliance Army made it this far.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]General Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, that's him.[A]
I wish to see how he fights...
by going up against him directly.[A]
[01B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, General Roy![A]
I have found you at last.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bishop Yodel![A]
What brings you out here all the
way from Etruria?[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I did some research after
receiving your letter.[A]
And I have come to the conclusion
that Bern has indeed resurrected[A]
[Clear][ToggleSmile]the Dark Dragon![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Is that true!?[A]
... But Hartmut defeated the
Dark Dragon in the war.[A]
How could Bern have brought
it back to life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Apparently Hartmut did defeat the
Dark Dragon, but he did not[A]
finish it off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Instead of killing it, he sealed
it away in the mountains of Bern.[A]
And the sword he used to seal
it was...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Sword of Seals?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, did you know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.
I studied a little...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Even if the Dark Dragon has broken out
of its seal, if we can obtain the[A]
Sword of Seals, then we may be able to
seal it again or kill it once and for all.[A]
That is the Church's conclusion, and they[A]
sent me to ask for your assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know where
the Dark Dragon is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my next point.[A]
As the fire-breathing Dragons
can change into human form, it is[A]
highly possible that the Dark Dragon
is as well.[A]
In fact, we currently have a suspect.[A]
The Dark Priestess that is always
at King Zephiel's side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Dark Priestess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
We have no solid evidence, but it[A]
is true that she appeared at around the
same time that the other fire-breathing[A]
Dragons started to appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their
power in gems called Dragon Stones to[A]
change into human form so that they could
adapt to this environment.[A]
In that case, it would not be surprising
if the Dark Dragon was in the form of[A]
human woman as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]In any case,
we have to go see her to[A]
confirm the truth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
I shall accompany you as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You would fight alongside us?
That would be most helpful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Also, take these.[A]
These are the Divine Weapons that the
Church found on its own.[A]
I have instructions to give them to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Divine Weapons too!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If the Dark Dragon has really been
released, then this is the greatest[A]
danger mankind has ever faced since
the Dragon Human wars![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
We will face it with all our strength.[A]
[01B5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x136]
[ToggleSmile]All right, let's go!
Crush them all.[A]
Leave none alive![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C7][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you dealt
with the Divine Weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,
we got rid of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
Now, we must go to[.....]

Is that all the resolve you had when

[OpenMidRight]No!
My mind is...set...[A]
Even now, it hurts to point my blade
toward Bern, my homeland...
But I believe that the path I chose
wasn't a mistake...![A]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Does that mean that

Perhaps we should ask those from

Am I allowed to use it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][CloseSpeechFast]It has been said for centuries that

Zephiel is residing in the throne

However, there are some special
devices that protect the throne[A]
room when invaders appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What kind of devices?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]One of the captives said that
at the west end of the castle[A]
there are some switches that
need to be maneuvered first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It'll be a long detour...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.[A]
After hitting the switches,
you must hold the 'Gem' in[A]
in front of the throne room
to make it open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gem?
Is it the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have that with me.[A]
So I should head to the throne

to the others...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be the shortest way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But would the captives leak
that kind of information so easily?[A]
Perhaps it's a trap...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.
The captive also said, 'The[A]
switches and the door are all defended
by Bern's most powerful warriors.[A]
Even if you knew how to get into the
throne room, you wouldn't be able to[A]
get there.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]We need to try, even if we're
going up against powerful enemies.[A]
We're pretty strong as well.
We won't lose![A]
[01C7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C]So this is Bern's castle...
It sure looks sturdy.[A]
There must be riches beyond
belief kept in here![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF]
[ToggleSmile]This is the switch?
Nothing's happening, though...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x149][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have come.[A]
Hmph...how ironic.
A child, stepping in my path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Zephiel...
King of Bern...[A]
[MoveRight]I will ask you this.
Why did you start this war![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
I wish to end the age of man.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Humans...
Humans are filthy.[A]
They flock to those with power and
would not think twice about betraying[A]
trusted allies to obtain more power.[A]
You must have witnessed numerous
traitors in your travels.[A]
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Jealousy. Hate. Greed.[A]
Friends, even family members would be
driven to kill by these stupid emotions.[A]
Such emotions make fathers who try to
kill their sons to save their own flesh.[A]
As long as humans control, as long as
humans dictate, as long as humans[A]
exist... this madness will never end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]But look at what you are doing![A]
You are one of those humans who
control other humans![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You know how the Scouring ended.[A]
[OpenRight]The Dark Dragon was
defeated by Hartmut...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That was the mistake.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]Mistake?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Mankind should not have won.[A]
Just because the humans came out
victorious, the world came under[A]
their control and transformed into
a world of madness and evil, driven[A]
by accursed emotions![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Mistakes must be fixed with haste.[A]
I will give back the world to
the Dragons.[A]
I will free the world from the
evil grasp of men.[A]
History must be redone from the
beginning again to save this[A]
world from everlasting evil![A][OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
Is it true you resurrected
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You may see that for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You said you would give the
world to the dragons.[A]
Then rule by humans would just be
replaced with similar rule by Dragons![A][OpenMidLeft]The Dragons you see now are
weapons for battle.[A]
They have no 'self'.[A]
They have no cruel emotions to
be driven by, unlike humans.[A]
The world under Dragons' control
would be fair and peaceful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot agree that such a world
would be for the better good![A]
It is true that humans have many
evil emotions and do terrible[A]
things, but it has always been us
humans who have corrected them![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hmph...
You are indeed naive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have faith in mankind.[A]
I will not lose to a man who has lost
faith in people and even in himself![A]
[01CB]
[LoadFace][0x149][ToggleSmile]You shall not bar my path![A]
[01CC]
[LoadFace][0x149][ToggleSmile].. So you have defeated
me...[A][Clear]
But remember...[A]
My will shall never die...[A]
As long as humans retain
control, madness will persist...[A]
[01CD]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]Zephiel has fallen...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x154]We've done it,
Master Roy.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B]...Or have we.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not see the
Dark Priestess anywhere...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Hm...
She escaped.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...So it seems.[A]

[01CF]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]What...[.....]
What the?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Zephiel's sword...
it glowed![A]
It's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Exaccus...[A]
A sword that only the
King of Bern can use...[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Master Roy,[A]
the legends say that
when all of the Divine Weapons[A]
come together, the Dragon
Temple rises out of the ground![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The Dragon Temple...[A]
[OpenFarRight]It was the
Dragon's Headquarters...[A]
Or at least, that's what
the legends say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
That is correct.[A]
[OpenRight]So is the Exaccus
the last Divine Weapon?[A]
I thought Hartmut's weapon
was the Sword of Seals.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Maybe...[A]
The Sword of Seals could be something
separate from the Divine Weapons...[A]
Perhaps it is even more powerful...[A]
[OpenRight]More powerful...?
What powers lie in this sword?[ToggleSmile][A]
[01D0]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]The sword glowed again![A]
The light is pointing
to the south![A][SendToBack]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight]So the Dragon Temple lies
to where the light in pointing?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]If the legends are true,
then that would indeed[A]
be the case.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]...If the Dark Priestess is
indeed the Dark Dragon...[A]
There is a high chance
that she would be there...[A]
[OpenRight]All right.

I knew you had your own problems
with your own nation...[A]
But you helped us.[A]
I must thank you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... I don't quite understand what you mean...
But if I have been helpful, then I am glad.[A]
[OpenRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]... Control over humans
by humans...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154]Zephiel's words?[A]
Perhaps he was right...
in a way.[A]
[OpenRight]...Has the Dark Priestess
been found?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No...[A]
Apparently she disappeared
before the battle.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]I see...[A]
Do you really think she's
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't know at all unless
I actually saw her.[A]
It's going to be difficult to find her
because she is said to be clad in[A]
a black robe all the time, and
no one has ever seen her up close.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
But the battle is now over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you saying!
The hard part has yet to come.[A]
We must help the land recover
from the war.[A]
There are people out there
who need our assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right!
We have work to do.[A]
The real battle is maybe
just beginning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
We are alive, so we must
think about the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No matter what hardships are to come,
I will never give up.[A]
We have to show that even humans can
construct a beautiful and peaceful world![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Master Roy, you will have
me at your side always![A]
Now, let us leave the castle
for now.[A][Clear]
We must spread the word of victory![A]

[ToggleSmile]Lord Yahn, here is Idoun.
Please take care of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What are you going
to do, human?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We will stay here and face
the Etrurian Army one last time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Do you have the troops?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The Dragon Knights scattered around
the continent have all returned[A]
under our cause.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have a chance
of victory?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Our chances of winning are
not high.[A]
But we are the Bern Army,
the strongest force on the[A]
continent.[A]
We shall at least show them
our unbending will.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will...[A]
You humans are incompressible
to us at times.[A]
Would your will raise your
chances of winning?[A]
Very well.[A]
We all have our methods of
battle.[A]
[01E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1D7][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Have you spread my
message?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
"Those who flee the army now will
not be tried guilty of fleeing.[A]
Whether to fight or to leave is
up to each his own."[A]
That was your message,
General Brenya.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]How many still
remain with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Almost all of the troops are
saying that they still wish to[A]
fight by your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All?
Our chances of victory are slim.[A]
I'm sure many of the troops have
family waiting for them.[A]
They must not feel pressured to
stay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are Knights of Bern,
my lady.[A]
We have no intention of bowing our
heads to Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I want you to expel those
who are injured and those who have[A]
young children or aged parents.[A]
They must not stay here.[A][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]But General Brenya...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is an order.
Understood?[A]
[01EA]

[01EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy,
our troops are ready.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...Did the messenger return?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
...As we suspected, the enemy has
no intention of surrendering.[A][OpenMidRight]Did you make it clear that their safety
would be guaranteed if they surrender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
But they said,[A]
'We appreciate your offer,
but we will not surrender.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Bern already officially surrendered...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This person might understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x157][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere...[.....]
Do you understand why?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes.[A]
...Bern recognizes itself as being the
strongest force in Elibe.[A]
Their pride would not allow them to
accept defeat without fighting.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x154][FastPrint]Master Roy!
The enemy is advancing![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]!
...We have no choice.[A]
We must fight![A]
Merlinus, send Princess Guinevere
to the back lines...[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft]No.
I will stay here.[A]
I...
must listen to their calls.[A]
That is all a...
traitor like myself can do...[A]

This will become a battlefield soon...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]So I see.

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What should we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Please do not worry.
I will protect the village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you![A]
We have nothing to fear with
the Sword Saint on our side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am just an ordinary swordsman.[A]
Rumors become larger with time,
so they must not easily be trusted...[A]
...But this battle seems to be
bigger than I thought.[A]
Is my sister all right...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I never knew you had a sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't seen her in a long time,

I'm fighting against Bern now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You...joined the war?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that you don't like getting

Did I make a mistake?[A]
Is this not good

[01F5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Temple...
The Dark Priestess is in here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We can count on that.
But...something is bothering me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]In one of the legends of the Scouring,
it is said that the Dragon Temple[A]
holds the power of the dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is also said that the temple's
power protects the Dragon itself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is just my estimate, but
perhaps it means that the Dragons[A]
inside the temple have much greater
power than those on the outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...[A]
Our tactics against the Dragons
until now might not work?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
But perhaps if one worthy of using
the Divine Weapons uses one to its[A]
fullest potential, then we might
have a chance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We have no other good ideas.
All right.[A]
Then we'll choose those who have
the best skill to enter the temple.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Be careful who you choose.[A]
We might not be able to leave
once we're inside...[A]
[01F6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Temple...
The air is strange.[A]
Did the Eight Heroes fight under
such pressure as well?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C]Would you stand before us
again, humans?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What...
Who are you![A]
When did you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I am Yahn.[A]
I am the last remaining Dragon
of the Dragon Temple.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]The last dragon?[A]
You seem different from the
other dragons...[A]
Are you the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons who you have been fighting
with are War Dragons who know nothing[A]
but battle.[A]
And the Dark Dragon is something
completely different from me.[A]
I am a full-blooded dragon who fought
you humans in the faraway past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Different?[A]
Wasn't the Dark Dragon supposed
to be the leader of the Dragons?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Dragon is an 'object'
that is meant to bring hope to us[A]
Dragons again.[A]
It is no leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.....]
Then what is the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems you have much to learn.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tell us![.....]
What is the Dark Dragon?[A]
We...I have to fully understand
my enemy before I fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...I have no reason to tell
you.[A]
And yet, I have no reason not
to tell you.[A]
What should I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]...All right.[A]
I shall test you to see if you
are worthy of hearing the truth.[A]
I am deep inside the temple.
Fend off our attacks and come to me.[A]
Then I shall explain everything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're right here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What you are seeing is just
an illusion.[A]
If you wish to know the truth,
then come to me.[A]
If you prove yourself worthy of[A]
my time, then you shall hear
it all...[A]
[01F7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You...
Are you real this time?[A]
Or...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is but the entrance.
You have a long way to reach me.[A]
But you seem strong enough
not to die immediately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have gone through
many hardships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I see.[A]
Very well, I shall tell you a little
about the Dark Dragon.[A]
The Dark Dragon is not the leader of
the Dragons as you thought.[A]
The Dark Dragon was created to bring
us victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Created...?[A]
So it wasn't the Dark Dragon
making more Dragons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragons you speak of are correctly
referred to as War Dragons.[A]
As I said before, they are different
from pure Dragons such as I.[A]
Indeed, the War Dragons are created[A]
by the Dark Dragon.[A]
And the Dark Dragon was created out
of the Divine Dragon, the most[A]
powerful of our kind.[A]
[OpenRight]Created out of the Divine Dragon?
Then the Dark Dragon is actually...[A]
The Divine Dragon agreed to become
the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Agreed?
No.[A]
We destroyed its soul so that it would
follow our leader's every command.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]What...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]We desperately needed the power of
the Divine Dragon.[A]
Our entire species was at stake.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You needed the power of the
Divine Dragon...[A]
But...why did you have to
destroy its soul![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why, you ask.[A][.....]
If you want that answer,
then seek me out again.[A]
I shall witness your power
further...[A]
[01F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not bad, not bad at all.
I wonder how far you will come.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to go
on with your story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No matter how much we fought,
you humans just seemed to multiply[A]
endlessly.[A]
Eventually, we began to lose because
of the humans' sheer number.[A]
Therefore, we created the Dark Dragon
that would make War Dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]War Dragons...
Dragons only meant for battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
But the Divine Dragons did not agree
with us.[A]
They said that would be defying the
laws of nature.[A]
As we were discussing how we could
persuade the Divine Dragons, they[A]
suddenly disappeared.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They most likely left us to prevent
us from taking advantage of them.[A]
We could not find the Divine Dragons,
but fortunately, we were able to[A]
capture one.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And that became the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
And that Divine Dragon, Idoun, was to
become the Dark Dragon.[A]
However, she felt hesitation in letting
the Divine Dragons and us other Dragons[A]
going on to bad terms.[A]
Hesitation...such nonsense is for humans
only.[A]
We have no need for it.[A][OpenMidRight]Then that hesitation worked
against you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Divine Dragon we captured was still
young, but we had no problem because[A]
it was good enough for our purpose.[A]
However, its heart was not with us.
It would not follow our commands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So...
You destroyed its heart...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
We destroyed its soul to make it
follow our every command.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's...terrible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is enough for now.[A]
If you want to know more, then
show me more of your power![A]
[01F9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You have taken another step forward.
But the way is still long.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We shall still reach you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have a stout heart.
What do you wish to hear next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You succeeded in creating the Dark Dragon.
The Dark Dragon produced War Dragons.[A]
Then why did you lose to the humans?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed, the Dark Dragon continued to produce
War Dragons to use in the battlefield.[A]
We were able to turn the tables on
the humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, the humans soon found out
about the Dark Dragon.[A]
They concluded that their numbers would
would not be enough to defeat us.[A]
Therefore, they put their efforts into
constructing powerful weapons that[A]
would pierce our scales.
They are what you would call the[A]
the Divine Weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That part is the same as
our legends...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most powerful and potent were
chosen out of the humans to wield[A]
their newly crafted weapons.[A]
They came and charged this temple.[A]
However, when the immense power of the
weapons and our power clashed near[A]
Bern, something unexpected happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The laws of Nature started to collapse.
Snow began to fall in mid summer.[A]
Stars shone in the middle of day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that the Ending Winter?[A]
I heard that happened because you Dragons
unleashed too much power into the world...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that how your legends go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The power in the Divine Weapons
were used to restore order in nature.[A]
That's what our legends say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All the bad things that happened are
all our fault.[A]
I would have expected you humans to
think like that.[A]
But the truth is what I said.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then the Divine Weapons were sealed
away so as not to let such a[A]
disaster happen again?[A]
Then all those traps that protected
them were to warn us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sealed them away?
That was a good decision.[A]
But they seem to be in
your hands right now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[A]
The weapons do not seem to have
as much power as they did in the past.[A]
They are unable to bring about
a disaster again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]The great disaster hurt us
Dragons greatly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The disaster was originally the reason
why we lost to the humans...[A]
I shall continue when you advance
a bit further...[A]
[01FA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]You have come here again.
You are doing better than I expected.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please continue the story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When the order of nature collapsed,
we Dragons took a fatal blow.[A]
The forces of nature weakened,
and it became difficult for us[A]
to retain our original Dragon form.[A]
Therefore, we decided to seal our
powers in gemstones and take the[A]
human form instead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those must be the
Dragon Stones...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Now we were utterly powerless against
the humans.[A]
In human form, we were just as weak,
no, even weaker than the humans.[A]
The humans took advantage of our
handicap and started attacking the[A]
Dragons that had taken human form.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why did you take human form?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In the new order of nature, the
human was the form that required the[A]
least energy to transform into.[A]
The Eight Heroes mercilessly crushed
us, helpless in our human form.[A]
I too suffered a deep wound.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you have hate for the
humans who wounded you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hate?
Only humans have such ridiculous emotions.[A]
We battled to maintain our species, and
we lost.[A]
That is all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, you humans might
lose this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Some human named Zephiel brought
the Dark Dragon back to life again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]!![A]
Then Zephiel did break the
Dark Dragon's seal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is correct.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]If you want to hear more, then show
me some more of your worthiness.[A]
[01FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yahn!
I know you're there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C]Hm...[A]
It seems that you did indeed
defeat Zephiel...[A]
You might make it far enough
to be able to fight me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What relation did the
Dark Dragon have to Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know that the founder of Bern
is the Hartmut, the leader of the[A]
Eight Heroes, do you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then do you know that Hartmut
didn't kill the Dark Dragon[A]
but only sealed it away?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
But I still don't know
why he did that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...
I see.[A]
The Eight Heroes eventually defeated our
leader, and they made their way deep into[A]
the temple to find the Dark Dragon.[A]
However, when they arrived at the Dark
Dragon's chamber, all they saw was a[A]
human girl, looking off into space.[A]
It was Idoun.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They didn't fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Dark Dragon had its soul destroyed
to follow our leader's commands.[A]
Since our leader had been killed,
there were no further commands to follow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then what happened
to the Dark Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Eight Heroes naturally hesitated.[A]
They had expected to see the most
powerful Dragon, but all they saw[A]
was a girl who wouldn't respond
even if spoken to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Dark Dragon still must be defeated,
so the Eight Heroes prepared for battle.[A]
The girl must then have reacted to their
attack.[A]
She changed into the Dark Dragon and
fought back, just like the War Dragons[A]
who have no heart.[A]
Hartmut then used a blade stronger than
the Divine Weapons and slashed at the[A]
Dark Dragon's scales.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Sword of Seals![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know what you humans call it,
but that must be it.[A]
Anyway, when the sword cut through the
Dark Dragon's flesh, it suddenly fell[A]
unconscious.[A]
[01FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have come far.
I am in the chamber right in front of you.[A]
It has been long since I last met humans
in my true form.[A]
I have not left this place ever since
the war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...
You were always here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]One thousand years...[A]
Having survived the Scouring, I waited,
healing my wounds in the process.[A]
I waited for the resurrection of the
Dark Dragon that would bring hope to[A]
us Dragons again.[A]
And that time came.[A]
The Dark Dragon's seal was broken,
and I felt power flowing through my[A]
veins again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How does the Dark Dragon's seal being
broken make your strength recover?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dragon Temple's power depends
on the Dark Dragon's, and thus the[A]
Divine Dragons' power.[A]
If the Dark Dragon were to be sealed,
then there is no way I could have[A]
recovered to full strength by using[A]
the temple's power.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]After my strength fully recovered,
I set out to look for the person who[A]
had broken the seal.[A]
I used my illusion to search him out
and ask his intentions.[A]
I did not wish to go outside in my
true form, knowing that you humans[A]
now ran the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait...[A]
I thought that Dragons in their
human form lost most of their powers.[A]
Then how are you creating this illusion?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This temple is for the Dragons.[A]
It is the only place that Dragons can use
a little of their power even in human form.[A]
I am a fairly powerful Dragon.[A]
Even in human form, as long as I stay in
the temple, creating illusions is easy.[A]
[01FD]
[LoadFace][0x14C]One thousand years...[A]
My strength has long
recovered.[A]
I can feel it...[A]
[01FE]
[LoadFace][0x14C][ToggleSmile]So, I have lost...[A]
Humans are truly
unpredictable...[A]

[01FF]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]In the next chamber
lies the Dark Dragon...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]...Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
What's wrong, Fa?[A]
You look you're about
to burst into tears.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is..
Is Fa also an enemy...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When...[A]
When Fa gets big, will Fa
become a bad Dragon too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, Fa.[A]
Tell me what want to
say, slowly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That man said so...
Dragons and people can't live together...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you were living in Nabata
with people, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Dark Dragon is a
Divine Dragon like Fa is![A]
And you're going to fight
Dark Dragon, right?[A]
What about Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If Fa grows up...
And becomes like the[A]
Dark Dragon, then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't have to worry about
that.[A]
Even if you grow up, you'll
always be Fa.[A]
You'll always live together
with humans, and with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure![A]
And also, I actually want to
help the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Help?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Dark Dragon is not acting
on her own will.[A]
She had her soul destroyed.[A]
I...I don't want to kill
her, if I can avoid it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa doesn't get it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand when you
get a little older.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Hartmut posed a question.
And I'll give an answer to it![A]
[0200]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]The Dark Dragon is in here...
Be careful, everyone.[A]
This is our last battle![A]

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You're the Dark Priestess..
No, the Dark Dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Why do you hinder my path?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I have been commanded to lead this world.[A]
I shall make the world a better place.
Why are you barring my performance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You are wrong.[A]
You were only told the world
would become a better place.[A]
The person who ordered you is
already dead.[A]
So stop![A]
You no longer have any reason
to fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You...
No, we...[A]
We have no reason to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...A long time ago...[A]
I have a feeling I heard those
same words.[A]
Soft words, like a warm breeze..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
But that was long ago...
I have been asleep for too long.[A]
In the darkness, I was dreaming...
An empty dream, white, colorless...[A]
But now I am awake.
His Majesty willed me so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Majesty...Zephiel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I have woken.
I am no longer who I used to be.[A]
I now clearly understand what
I must do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14A][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I must lead this world...[A]
No matter how many days or
nights pass, I must.[A]
I must...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You insist on fighting us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As long as you stand in
my path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Such strong...will...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]His Majesty wishes it to be.[A]
And I was woken to answer his
Majesty's calls.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
Leave the rest to me.
Now go!![A]
[023A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
You are all right![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
[ToggleSmile]But the temple is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released[A]
in the battles just fought.[A]
The building probably couldn't
withstand it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So times are changing again.
And...[A]
Who is that you are carrying
on your back?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x14B][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Her?
Oh, right.[A]
Merlinus,
I need to ask something of you...[A]
[023B]
And thus this conflict, called 
[023C]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[023D]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[023E]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[023F]
but never directly interfered 
[0240]
in their state affairs. 
[0241]
With the help of Roy, 
[0242]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[0243]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[0244]
with Guinevere as its queen. 
[0245]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[0246]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Princess Guinevere is to
be crowned today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't see her in her
royal garments yet.[A]
She must look beautiful
beyond words.[A]
Even when I first met her,
I couldn't believe that such a[A]
beautiful person existed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But the princess' hardships
are still to come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if she becomes queen
of Bern with Etruria's help,[A]
I'm sure there will be a lot of
rebellion and unrest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think that there might be
people who'll say that Princess[A]
Guinevere joined Etruria just to
seize the throne.[A]
She'll have to face them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But I think Princess
Guinevere will be fine.[A]
And then Bern will become
a much better nation than before..[A]
[ToggleSmile]She's just so smart...
And strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...
I think so too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What are you going
to do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
I'll return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we'll have to[A]
start rebuilding the lands
that were trampled on by[A]
the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...Nothing.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you're returning
to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?[A]
You're going back to Ostia,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.
I must take my father's place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm glad to hear that
you'll be staying in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because if you're in Ostia, then
I can go meet you any time I want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[A]
I don't know when,
but some day...[A]
I'll go pick you up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I...
I have to prepare, too..[A][Clear]
But...Roy...
I always...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
The ceremony's starting.
Come on, Lilina, we have to[A]
[ToggleSmile]go see Princess...
I mean, Queen Guinevere![A]
And pay our respects![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...I always...
What!?[A]
R-Roy, wait for me![A][ClearFace]
[0247]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere,
congratulations on your crowning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But my battle is only about
to begin.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
I had to rely on Etruria
to fulfill my task.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am grateful.[A]
However, I think that there will
[ToggleSmile]be people who will think that[A]
I joined Etruria just to seize
the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the most important thing now
is to rebuild Bern.[A]
I will try my best to gain the
people's trust by bringing[A]
Bern back to life.[A]
No matter how long it takes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If there is anything I can
do to help, please don't[A]
hesitate to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
Some day I might.
Roy, are you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you going to do?
Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No,
I will return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we have to start[A]
rebuilding the lands that were
trampled by the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You are returning to your homeland?
That is just like you.[A]
Still...[A]
Someone of your ability could easily
aim for high power in the Etrurian Court.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-Me!? No no no,
I have no such ability![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pherae's people are fortunate
to have such a gifted leader as you.[A]
[0248]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x152][ToggleSmile]Princess...[.....]
I mean, Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Guinevere is fine.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Guinevere.
The ceremony is about to begin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[.....]
I will be there shortly...[A]
[0249]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy,
will you come with me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ever since I left Bern with the Fire
Emblem, you have helped me tremendously.[A]
I want you to see the path Bern will
take with my leadership.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
If it is all right with you, then
I will be glad to accompany you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let us go see a new Bern...
And a new age.[A]

[024A]
Later, in Arcadia...
[024B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x161][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Master Roy.
It has been a long time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I had business in these areas,
so I decided to stop by on the way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa will be glad to see you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I saw her earlier.
She is as energetic as ever.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She is being allowed outside
more these days.[A]
Perhaps that is why.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How is the girl
I sent here doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We succeeded in restoring
her soul, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...She still won't go
back to normal?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa sometimes takes her outside,
but she won't try to do anything[A]
on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We knew that the girl you sent here
was captured by the Dragons.[A]
Still, we did not try and rescue her.[A]
We feared that our kind would be
in danger if we showed ourselves[A]
in front of them again.[A]
But now, I wonder whether
my judgment was correct...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps it is because we
have begun to live with humans.[A]
I will make my best efforts to
bring the girl's heart back fully.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As a first, I would like to see some
sign that her emotions are working...[A]
Like laughing or crying, or something...[A]
[024C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]
And that[......] is called[......] a[......]
tree![.......][.....]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tree...[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right![.....][......]
And that [......]tree gives[.....]
yummy fruit![.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fruit?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. [......]Can you see?
It's up at the top.[.......][......]
And if you [......]shake the tree[......]
like this...[MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oww![MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It fell on[......]
Fa's head...[.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]...? [......]Did you[......]
just[......] laugh?[.......][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Laugh...?[......]This is to laugh?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where's [......]Roy? [......]Fa has to[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]tell Roy[......]
that [......]Idoun laughed![A] 
[024D]

[024E]

[024F]

[0250]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14A]A warm...breeze...[.....][......][......]
[0251]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile]What's happening...
The temple is starting to collapse![A]
Everyone!
Hurry outside![A]
[0252]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy!
You are all right![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
[ToggleSmile]But the temple is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is over a thousand years old,
and a lot of energy was released[A]
in the battles that we just fought.[A]
Probably the building couldn't
withstand it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, Master Roy,
this is the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's not over yet.
This is just the beginning.[A]
We have to help the land and
the people recover from the war.[A]
We have much work to do.
The real battle is just beginning![A]
[0253]
And thus this conflict, called 
[0254]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[0255]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[0256]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[0257]
but never directly interfered 
[0258]
in their state affairs. 
[0259]
With the help of Roy, 
[025A]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[025B]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[025C]
with Guinevere as its queen. 
[025D]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[025E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Princess Guinevere is to
be crowned today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't see her in her
royal garments yet.[A]
She must look beautiful
beyond words.[A]
Even when I first met her,
I couldn't believe that such a[A]
beautiful person existed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But the princess' hardships
are still to come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if she becomes queen
of Bern with Etruria's help,[A]
I'm sure there will be a lot of
rebellion and unrest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think that there might be
people who'll say that Princess[A]
Guinevere joined Etruria just to
seize the throne.[A]
She'll have to face them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But I think Princess
Guinevere will be fine.[A]
And then Bern will become
a much better nation than before..[A]
[ToggleSmile]She's just so smart...
And strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...
I think so too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What are you going
to do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
I'll return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's
illness, and we'll have to[A]
start rebuilding the lands
that were trampled on by[A]
the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...Nothing.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you're returning
to Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?[A]
You're going back to Ostia,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.
I must take my father's place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm glad to hear that
you'll be staying in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because if you're in Ostia, then
I can go meet you any time I want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[A]
I don't know when,
but some day...[A]
I'll go pick you up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I...
I have to prepare, too..[A][Clear]
But...Roy...
I always...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
The ceremony's starting.
Come on, Lilina, we have to[A]
[ToggleSmile]go see Princess...
I mean, Queen Guinevere![A]
And pay our respects![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...I always...

R-Roy, wait for me![A][ClearFace]
[025F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere,

[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]

Roy, are you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you going to do?
Will you remain in the Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No,
I will return to Pherae.[A]
I'm worried about my father's

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Guinevere is fine.

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Guinevere.
The ceremony is about to begin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[.....]
I will be there shortly...[A]
[0261]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x157][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy,
will you come with me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ever since I left Bern with the Fire
Emblem, you have helped me tremendously.[A]
I want you to see the path Bern will

[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
If it is all right with you, then
I will be glad to accompany you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let us go see a new Bern...
And a new age.[A]

[0262]
Peace returned to the world, 
[0263]
and the people slowly began to recover. 
[0264]
As stability returned, 
[0265]
Elibe faced a new age of prosperity. 
[0266]
And thus, 
[0267]
the story of the many people 
[0268]
who mourned, wept, and laughed 
[0269]
during this great conflict 
[026A]
came to a close...

[LoadFace][0x142]Well, if it isn't
General Percival, the traitor![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x11A][ToggleSmile]
Joining you...was the biggest

And now I shall repent

[02AA]
[LoadFace][0x147][ToggleSmile]You were one of Narshen's

I heard the story from Gale.[A]
I do feel sorry for you,

So you have chosen the[A]

Guinevere.[A]
That is one way...
But I have chosen my path,[A]

[LoadFace][0x148][ToggleSmile]You are a knight of Bern?[A]
[ToggleSmile]So you have chosen
the path with Princess Guinevere.[A]
That is one way...
But I have chosen my own path,[A]
[ToggleSmile]as you yours. I must

[LoadFace][0x145]You...[A]
You're Yuno's youngest sister.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x129][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x145]By the honor of an Ilian Knight...
I won't go easy on you.[A]
All right?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x129][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A][ClearFace]
[02B4]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina?[A]
Damn, you were supposed
to be dead by now...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x122]Leygance...
Why?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144]Times are changing,
my Lady.[A]
I'm just making sure
I don't get left behind.[A]
I'm not like Lord Hector,[A]
who was too foolish to
realize the change.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x122]Quiet!
You will not insult[A][.....]
my father any further![A]
[02B5]
[LoadFace][0x108][ToggleSmile]Leygance, you fool![A]
Are you not ashamed that
you betrayed Lord Hector?![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144]Barth... Shut up.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Lord Hector stupidly caused
his death.[A]
I do not plan on falling
with him.[A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x108][ToggleSmile]Why, you...![A]
[02B6]
[LoadFace][0x144]Bors! So you were
still alive.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
Taking over Ostia while
we weren't around...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Is that a problem?[A]
Then try and take it back
with your own strength and skill![A]
[02B7]
[LoadFace][0x1BD][ToggleSmile]General Leygance!
You shall rest here![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x144][ToggleSmile]Ah, Bors' sister, is it?[A]
It's nice to be brave and all,
but can you really defeat me?[A]
[02B8]
[LoadFace][0x13C][ToggleSmile]Bors! You returned![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x109]Causing a rebellion during
Lord Hector's absence?![A][Clear]
That is unforgivable![A]
[02B9]
[LoadFace][0x146][ToggleSmile]Klein!
You would betray me?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x10D]You are the one who
betrayed Etruria,[A][Clear]
Lord Arcard![A]
[02BA]
[LoadFace][0x146][ToggleSmile]D-Douglas![A]
You had turned to the enemy...!?[A]

[02BB]
[LoadFace][0x13D]Douglas...hmph!
After all that you said,[A]
you too are following
those with power![A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x10A][ToggleSmile]Perhaps it may seem that way
from the outside. But there is[A]
[ToggleSmile]no hesitation in my
heart now.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x13D][ToggleSmile]Silence!
I've had just about enough[A]
of you. Die here![A]
[02BC]
[LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]You are a priest...[A]
Are you not?[A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x140][ToggleSmile]What of it?[A]
Anything can go unpunished...
If done in the name of God![A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x10F][ToggleSmile]...That's unforgivable.[A][ClearFace]
[02BD]
[LoadFace][0x10E][ToggleSmile]We certainly have an evil
bishop here now, don't we?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x140][ToggleSmile]I am simply living
life the way I see fit.[A]
Anything can go unpunished
if it's in the name of God.[A]
Convenient,
is it not?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadFace][0x10E][ToggleSmile]You disgrace God...[A]
Then you shall be
punished for that![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh, okay.[A]
Then is there anything I could

[OpenMidRight]Roy, it's all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'll be fine.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, in that case...[A]
But if there's anything you need,
tell me.[A]

Lilina![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
You were looking off into space again.[A]
We're in a battle.
You could get killed![A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just that...
We've come a long way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Long?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not distance-wise...[A]
It's just that everything seems to
be changing so quickly.[A]
Do you remember the time when you
came to Ostia to study?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
2 years...[A]
Wait, was it 3 years ago?[A]
[OpenMidRight]At that time, your father and my
father were still well.[A]
Lycia was so peaceful...
No one would have imagined a war.[A]
...It all seems as if it were 10
years ago.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I sound so foolish...[A]
There's no way we can go back
there anyway...[A]
[030E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
Roy...
I'm sorry about the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was on some
nostalgia trip, remember?[A]
We're in a war...
Of course things won't be the same...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, some things will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be at your side,
and you'll be at mine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We can't go back to the past,
but we can shape the future.[A]
Then we should work to make
a future the same as, or even[A]

better than the past, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hehehe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy, you're showing off...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-Do you think so?[A]
Yeah, I was thinking that didn't
sound like me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We'll always be together...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter, Marcus?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not good.
Not good at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's not good?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The youths these days, their fighting
has much to be desired.[A]
It isn't all of them, but most of them
seem pampered in my eyes![A]
We must make stricter exercise plans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I don't think they're pampered...
They're all doing their best.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No![A]
Master Roy,
you are too soft on them.[A]
I shall go and show them
an example![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you sure you have to
go on your own?[A]
You're not, you know,
young anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nonsense![A]
I may be old, but I shall not
lose to the young ones yet![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...okay.[A]
But you're still not young any more,
so watch out for your health.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, of course.
Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy is so thoughtful...[A]
Now look at those other young ones
compared to him...disgraceful![A]
I must help Master Roy in their
place.[A]
[0310]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy, I still think that
we should make our rules stricter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Stricter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
And we expel those who aren't
doing their job properly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Although our army will be small,
we will have a team of elites.[A]
That way, we can fight more
efficiently.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Marcus.[A]
That's not a good idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh...
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who's going to choose whether
someone is not doing their job?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, that would
be you, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But some people might be
working when I'm not looking.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Well, in that case...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are also people supporting us
outside of the battlefield, and there[A]
also those whom we don't use because
of my decisions who haven't yet had[A]
a chance.[A]
You want to simply expel them all?[A]
We have many people who joined us
with strong beliefs.[A]
We can't just tell them to leave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Marcus, we have to trust them more.
They're our comrades, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You are right.[A]
I was mistaken, Master Roy.
Your thoughts are noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, it's kind of strange
hearing you praise me like that.[A]
You're usually scolding me most
of the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Am I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy...
He has gotten so bold...[A]
He can now certainly live on
his own.[A]
My role is almost finished...[A]

[0311]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C]
[OpenMidLeft]Marcus, is something wrong?
You seem not well these days.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
When I think of a good time
that I should retire...[A]
Well, aging certainly
isn't a fun thing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retire?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The young soldiers have grown strong.
Perhaps it is the right time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Marcus.
What are you saying?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am old...[A]
It wouldn't be for your benefit
that an old man like me by your side.[A]
I should give way for the next
generation...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I should be retiring soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No![A]
I order you to stay![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll apologize if you're angry
about what I said the other day.[A]
So don't say you'll retire.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But an old man like me...
I shouldn't be in battles anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still have lots of things
that I need to learn from you.[A]
But if you leave...
Who can I turn to for advice?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy...
You trust this old knight so much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't say you'll retire...[A]
I still need your help from
now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I shall serve you till my death...[A]
[0312]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy,[.....]
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Just call me Roy.
We grew up like brothers, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I appreciate your kindness,
but rules are rules.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?[A]
You've suddenly become
a faraway person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are you saying?[.....]
I'm right here in front of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not what I mean.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Haha, I know.[A]
But I must not slack off in areas
like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well then, let's go![A]
We have a long ways yet,
Master Roy.[A]
[0313]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wolt!
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy, that conversation
was settled.[A]
More importantly, this
is a battlefield.[A]
You never know where
enemies are hiding.[A]
Please be sure to keep
on your guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt...[A]
You're starting to sound like
Merlinus and Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Am I?
Thank you![A]
That is such praise.[A]
My goal is to become a loyal
servant like them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nothing.[A]
Leave me alone for a while,
will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...?[A]
[0314]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not look well.
Is there something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Well, actually there is.
Would you mind if we talked about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]!
Of course![A]
I'll do my best to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You see, I'm kind of angry
at this person in the army.[A]
What he's saying is true
and makes sense, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
What you understand intellectually
and what you feel are two different[A]
things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.[A]
My feelings don't agree
with what I understand.[A]
And then I start to get mad and
I feel like telling him about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then do so![A]
Keeping it inside of you is
bad for your health.[A]
And besides, you are at a
stressful position.[A]
No one would get angry if you
spill it out once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
If you want, I can go talk to the
person.[A]
Even if the whole world turns against
you, I will always be at your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, okay.
Thanks Wolt.[A]
I feel better now.[A]
All right!
We have to get moving![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly, Master Roy![A]
[ToggleSmile]...By the way, I can tell the
person you're mad at and have a[A]
little discussion with him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
...Who was it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He's closer than you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Where?[A]
.......
...Is it...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yup![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy![A]
[0315]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy,
how should I move next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes.[A]
You should...
...um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's just that...
It feels strange to give you orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
You are this army's leader.
You are supposed to give orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, you mustn't soften up.[A]
If the leader gets soft, so
do the troops.[A]
You are the general leading 
this army, and I am a squad[A]
leader in your army.[A]
So you must be strict, as a
general should be.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good.[A]
Now, General Roy,
what is my next move?[A]
[0316]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Phew...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, General Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I can't.
We must keep moving.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rushing will only
bring failure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not rushing.[A]
I won't try anything impossible.
But we must move as quickly as we can.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The quicker we move,
we can reach more people in need.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, that's true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We are fighting to win this war.[A]
However, if we focus only on winning,

and ignore those people need help,[A]
is that a true victory?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I'm sorry...
I shouldn't be so outspoken.[A]
Have I angered you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm glad.
I was too focused on winning the battle.[A]
You are already becoming a great leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But...hearing that from
you is encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[0317]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]What are you going to do
after this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Do you already think
you've won?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
We must rebuild Etruria,
so I will return there first.[A]
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was just wondering if[ToggleSmile] you could teach
me again once the war has ended.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like the time in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
There's no need for that anymore.
You have become a wonderful leader.[A]
There is nothing more I can teach
you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, you must have confidence.[A]
Troops will not follow a leader who
does not even have confidence in himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is the last thing
I can teach you.[A]
From now on, you are not
my student.[A]
You are my colleague and
friend.[A]
If there's anything I can
help you with after the war,[A]
I would be glad to assist you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
I will always be on your side.
Never forget that.[A]

You shouldn't strain yourself...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]In battle...
There is a bad omen...[A]
Please stay out of the front lines...[A]
[OpenMidRight]![.....]
...All right.[A]
But I don't think I can follow
your warning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]... Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When I go up front...
It's because I trust the others.[A]
I can't be hiding in the back,
fearing injury.[A]
I have to fight alongside the
others.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for warning me,
but...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0319]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sophia?
Did you feel something again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I just wanted to apologize...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apologize?
To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About the other day...[A]
I told you that I could sense a bad
omen in the middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...[A]
You have such a burden...
And I said something...[A]
that would worry you more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm actually glad that you told
me.[A]
I was more careful that time.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you hadn't told me that,[A]
I probably wouldn't have been as
careful as I had.[A]
I could have been hurt badly.[A]
So thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So if you sense something from
now on, can you tell me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[031A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy...
I must tell you something...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My power...
It is not very strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can see the future...
But it is only a vague image...[A]
Something truly powerful...
I cannot see...[A]
I just wanted to tell you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Something truly powerful?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
If I could not sense something
very powerful...and if you were[A]
to be hurt because of it...
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.
But I'll be fine.[A]
When the time comes, we'll
manage to do something about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sensing the future is an
amazing thing.[A]
We could prevent disasters
before they even occur.[A]
But I won't be too reliant on
your power, so don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to see you smile more
than your power.[A]
I'm sure we'll face more hardships
as we go along...[A]
But the least we could do is keep
our spirits up, right?[A]
Let's go![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Thank you...Master Roy...[A]
[031B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Phew, I've finished outlining
the troops' positions...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?[A]
Oh, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
You have a strange look on your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just that I was a little surprised
that you came up and spoke to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...[A]
I never see you speaking
with other people.[A]
You don't like talking
that much?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not the case.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It isn't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's just that I like talking with
other things more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Other things?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The breeze, the trees,
the sky, the brooks...[A]
They are all speaking
to us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
If you listen, you'll hear
them.[A]
You can't hear them because
you're not listening.[A]
See you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
I thought you had
something to tell me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Be sure to listen to nature,
and you'll hear all sorts of voices.[A]
You'll feel better after that.
If you're stressed all the time,[A]
you won't be able to hear anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sue...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Was she trying to cheer me up
because I was tired...?[A]
[031C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for cheering
me up the other day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You look better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your feel...
It's become better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My feel?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It has become softer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?
I can't really tell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps things like these cannot be
recognized by those who work the[A]
land as compared to those who run
through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]....[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's the first time
I've seen you smile.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Your smile has a good 'feel'
to it too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
Thank you.[A]
[031D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]What are you going to do
when this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll return to Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But the Kutolah clan
was destroyed by Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We'll gather everyone together again.[A]
Perhaps there is no more Kutolah clan,
but not everyone in the Kutolah is dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
I guess that's right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was just thinking that if you
don't have any place to go, you[A]
can come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pherae...
Your hometown.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right...[A]
It's not a huge city, but it's
a nice and peaceful place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But my heart is in the
plains of Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, okay.[A]
But if you ever change your
mind, just tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks for cheering me up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're very welcome.[A]
[031E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]What's the matter, Master Roy?
Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
I was just thinking that you seem
so...free of worries.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey!
...Are you making fun of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No!
I'm envious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I still think I'm being
made fun of.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm not making fun of you.[A]
You see, I have to always show people
that I'm happy and confident because[A]
I'm the leader.[A]
But I often get depressed or become
worried.[A]
Oh, I wanted to ask you, is there
some kind of tip that you can give[A]
me to stay happy like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tip?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You know, something to do or a
certain mindset you should be in,[A]
or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
Eat well, sleep well,
and laugh well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Is that all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Probably.[A]
That's all you need to enjoy
life, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
Maybe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think you're thinking
too deeply.[A]
Well, probably, you have to because
you're in such a position...[A]
Anyway, I don't think it's as
complicated as you think.[A]
[031F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]You said you're a Pegasus Knight
in training, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How come you're in an army
outside Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the rule.[A]
If you fight outside Ilia, you'll gain
things you wouldn't be able to inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Foreign fighting styles,
foreign culture...[A]
And of course, money.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Then wouldn't it be a hindrance
if you stay in this army so long?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?
No, of course not![A]
There's no other army that's traveling
all over the place like this.[A]
It's great training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
Okay, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...
Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks![A]
[0320]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidRight]Thany, what are you going to do
when this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
Well... First off, I'll
probably go back to Ilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your hometown?
I'd love to![A]
I wanted to see it once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it's not a huge city like
Ostia, so you might be disappointed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My hometown is probably more
countryside than yours.[A]
Plus it snows a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then everything's fine, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll look forward to going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure.[A]
If you like it, you can stay
as long as you want.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy is so nice...[A]
Inviting a mercenary like me to his
hometown, and saying I can stay as[A]
long as I want..[A]
Wait...
Does that mean...?[A]
No no, don't get cocky...
But still...hmm...[A]
[0321]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]Wha-!?[A]
[OpenFarRight]L-Lalum...![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I'm glad I found you!
I want to show you something.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]W-Wait!
Calm down first...[A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]So...What was it you wanted?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Sooo![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Wait wait!
I can hear you from here![A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]I've come up with
a new dance,[A]
and I want you to see it.
It goes like this...[A][Clear]
Well?
Well?[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's very nice.
I think you're a very good dancer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Is that it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You know...
Isn't there more?[A]
Like, 'You look beautiful' or
'Your hair looks great today'[A]
or something...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uhm...
I better get going...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey![A]
[0322]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]L-Lalum...![A]
I don't think you should on to
people like that so much...[A]
People might have misunderstandings.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]But Roy...
...[A][Clear]
!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Eeek!
There's an enemy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Enemy!?
Where![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know!
But I heard the bushes rustle..[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]L-Lalum!
Calm down...[A]
I can't move if you're grabbing
on to me like that...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I'm going to die!
But...it's okay.[A]
If I can die for Master Roy,
it would be my only wish now.[A]
You, hiding over there!
Come out![A]
Our love is eternal,
and can never be broken![A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]P-Please, can you get
off of me so I can fight..[A]
[0323]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lalum...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you are!
I have another dance to show you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy...?[A]
Are you...trying to avoid
me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah...[A]
N-No!
Not at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes you are.[A]
As soon as I came,
you stepped back.[A]
You're already prepared
to dodge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-You're imagining things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your eyes are wandering...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...
You don't like me...[A]
You don't want to see my dancing
at all![A]
That's it![A]
[OpenMidRight]T-That's not true!![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Really!?
Thanks![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A]
[0324]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmmm....[A]
[OpenMidRight]Master Roy,
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Master Roy![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh!
Alan.[A]
Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you
worrying over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was just thinking how
to move our troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How to move the troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
The enemy is growing stronger all the time,
so good methods quickly become obsolete.[A]
I was wondering how to effectively break
through their defense lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's easy, Master Roy!
Leave it to me.[A]
I shall have their defense
shattered in no time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[A]
But I don't want to put anyone
in danger either.[A]
There has to be a better way...
I'll think some more.[A]
[0325]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, I have an idea
to break the enemy's defense...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
First, we save our best troops and use the
others to clash with the enemy's front lines.[A]
Then we shall find a weakness.[A]
Please, leave that role to me
and my squad![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But that group will be
in great danger...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We might have some casualties,
but we can win the battle![A]
Besides, I am not so easily
defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Alan,
I can't consider that idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't use a plan that we know
will have casualties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Master Roy, casualties
cannot be avoided in a war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think they can be.[A]
I might sound naive, but I don't
consider a victory with casualties[A]
to be a true victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A true victory...[A]
Can there be truth in a victory
of war?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think there can be.[A]
That's why I want to come up
with a good plan.[A]

[0326]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still thinking,
Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I can't think of a good plan yet...
But not your plan, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I understand,
Master Roy.[A]
But if there's anything I can do,
please tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I honestly still cannot decide whether
there is such a thing as true victory.[A]
But if you believe it, then I will
support you with all my strength.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Alan.[A]
I'm sure there will come a day when
you'll understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I shall look forward
to that day![A]
[0327]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Master Roy!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I...couldn't see you,
so...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh.
Is that all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that is not all,
Master Roy.[A]
You are this army's leader.
You must watch for your safety more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, you're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I promise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0328]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Roy, if I may
suggest something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How about if you stay out of the
front lines for a while?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you are thinking,
but please understand.[A]
An army's leader is crucial.[A]
If the leader is lost, so is
the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...[.....][A]
[OpenMidRight]But I don't think anyone would listen
to me if I only keep myself safe and[A]
start telling people what to do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true![A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not particularly smart, and I
don't have much charisma either.[A]
So I have to gain trust by experiencing
the pain that everyone else is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps I'm not meant to be a leader.[A]
Perhaps it's just how I am.[A]
[0329]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Lance, I've been thinking about what
you said, but I still think that I[A]
should stay up front.[A]
I know you were suggesting it for
my sake, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, perhaps I was too focused on my own
opinions.[A]
If you believe that your way is the best,
then it is best to pursue that path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
It's encouraging to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]However, you made one mistake
the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I did?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You said, "I'm not particularly smart,
and I don't have much charisma either."[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes, I did say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]That's the part about you that people
like.[A]
No one would give his life to someone
who has no charisma at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
If I may also add a comment, be sure
to keep that pure heart.[A]
As long as you do, our troops will
follow you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'll try.
Thank you, Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I am glad to be of
assistance.[A]
[032A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Ahh!
Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-What!
What's wrong, Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You look wonderful in that
outfit today![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And I was wondering what in the world
happened when you screamed like that...[A]
Is that all?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Klein![A]
In this army, everyone is just so
aesthetically handicapped![A]
You truly shine when you are among
them, Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine, you only think that
because I'm your family...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No![A]
There is no one else in the world who could
match you.[A]
Perhaps General Percival has more authority,
but you will always be most beautiful![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Clarine, a fine lady wouldn't
say things like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it is true.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I will try harder
if you tell me to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, do so.[A]
[032B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine, come over here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Klein?
How do you fare today?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not too well, I'm afraid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is true that you said harsh things
to the cleric and made her cry?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I did not make her cry.
She is the one who just stared crying.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...So it's true that she
did cry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is her fault!
She was sucking up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]She was healing your wounds
before I got the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Clarine![A]
[OpenMidRight]But I wanted to heal your injuries
so that you would be proud of me[A]
and would say that I was being a
great help, and...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But I was proud of you.[A]
I was thinking that my naive little
sister's so grown up now...[A]
But now that you've done this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'll never do it again![A]
Please don't hate me, Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about.
I'll never hate you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you, Klein![A]
[032C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I... I don't want to go back to
the mansion after the war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
Father and Mother are anxious
for us to return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to meet Father and Mother...[A]
But if I return to the mansion,
I would just be a doll again.[A]
I would never see the outside world,
and I would only be concerned[A]
about decorating myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that is how most Etrurian
ladies are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know...[A]
But becoming the most elegant in
Etruria does not seem as appealing[A]
as it once did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's because you're growing up
and maturing, Clarine.[A]
If you stay at the mansion, you could just
live your life without doing anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it would be so horribly
boring![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed...
All right, then here's what we will do.[A]
Once this war is over, we will first
go back home and show Father and Mother[A]
that we are safe and well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then we can discuss your future
and what you want to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I already know what I want
to do![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will become a Sorcery General
like General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
As the Sorcery General, I will help your
work as the Archery General, and then we[A]
shall always be together![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...let's try and be
a little more realistic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it would be so wonderful to see
us both in the elegant uniform[A]
of the Etrurian Generals...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...[A]
Well, you're still a little
girl, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
[032D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Oh!
We certainly do meet a lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is not 'you.'
I am Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I have always wanted to tell
you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]It is about how you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]??[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You actually do have quite an attractive
face.[A]
Of course, it would come nowhere near
my beloved brother Klein, but you are[A]
quite impressive for a commoner.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Therefore, I can use my advanced
Etrurian esthetic sense and make you[A]
into a truly handsome noble...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! Wait!
Where did he go?[A]
I was not finished speaking to him!
So he is just a tramp after all![A]
[032E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There you are!
I won't let you go this time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Knock it off.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
That is no way to respond
to someone's kindness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're starting to get on
my nerves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!
Insulting a lady like that...[A]
That...is not how a proper
Gentleman...should act...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight]... ...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...All right, I'm sorry.
...Don't cry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm not...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...I know he is not to blame...
But why am I acting this way...?[A]
[032F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]... Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You dropped this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Oh, my ribbon...[A]
[ToggleSmile]You brought it to me.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Um...[A]
I just realized...
I don't know your name...[A]
Would you please tell me your name,
if it would not be any trouble?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Rutger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
I never even thanked you for
saving me...[A]
It is no wonder you don't
like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you for rescuing me that
time...[A]
I know it is already too late,
but if you would accept my thanks..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Not like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't try something you're
not used to.[A]
You're good at screaming,
so why don't you do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What!?
What do you mean by that!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you go...
That's more like you.[A]
Come like that and make me
laugh once in a while, Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger...[A]
[0330]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight]Excuse me,
would you mind sitting still?[A]
I'll heal your wounds for you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's a kid like you doing
in the battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you lost?
Where are your parents?[A]
[OpenMidRight]!!!!
You infidel![A]
Do you have any idea who...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah yeah, you're some kid of
some high rank nobility, right?[A]
That still doesn't explain
why you're here, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]!!!
You filthy...![A]
Listen in awe![A]
I am Clarine of the Reglay family
of Etruria![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Then you're Lord Pent's...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you know my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein's little sister...[A]
[OpenMidRight]!
You know Klein too!?[A]
Who...are you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing.
Forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's not nothing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Clarine, was it?
Be careful out there.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]What!?
Wait![A]
...
Who is he...?[A]
[0331]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...So I'm telling you to speak!
Who are you?[A]
Keeping quiet won't benefit you
in any way![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you ever shut up?
Gimme a break, kid...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Fine.[A]
Well, Miss Clarine, I don't really
approve of girls going around chasing[A]
after guys' asses.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What!?
You have such a foul mouth...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
You don't want to be around
someone like me, now, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will not be fooled.
You are just trying to drive me away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Geez, she's not cute at all...
Are you really part of that family?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's it!
I want to ask about my brother![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dammit, I'm falling into her pace!
Cunning kid...[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Wait!
Wait, I say![A]
[0332]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...All right, you win.
I'll tell you.[A]
So just stop following me everywhere..[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Finally, we understand each other.
Please begin, I am listening.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's really not that big of a deal...[A]
It's just that I once worked for your
family as a pit fighter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]!?
Then...[A]
Are you Dieck?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I always wanted to meet you, Dieck![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You saved my brother's life![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who told you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Everyone!
My father, my mother, my brother...[A]
I grew up hearing all these good

things about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]When you left, I was still little...[A]
I remember that I always regretted
not being able to see you.[A]
But now, here we are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...
Well, now you've seen me.[A]
Satisfied?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Then you'll stop hovering
around me wherever I go, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'll follow you everywhere![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you saved my brother's life, then
that means you are an important person[A]
to me as well.[A]
And I want you to tell me what my
brother was like when he was young...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I don't think so.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh!
Wait, Dieck![A]
I won't let you go![A]
[0333]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight]Oh?
You are...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, you must be Lady Clarine,
princess of the Reglay family.[A]
I am Lance, knight of Pherae.[A]
We are honored to have one of
your stature with our army.[A]
Please forgive any impudence you
may have experienced so far.[A]
We are in a war, and people are
uptight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Yes, I shall forgive that for you.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is for you, and it
makes you very special![A]
All right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, thank you, my lady.
Now, let me take your hand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My...[A]
You have much respect for a
countryside knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am honored.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Of course, you are still nothing
compared to our knights.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive my lack of prowess,
my lady.[A]
[0334]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Clarine, is there something
I can get for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]As the princess of the Reglay family
I order you to protect me from now on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That means...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are a little weak to be defending
me, to tell the truth...[A]
But since we are in these conditions,
I will settle with you.[A]
You must stay by my side and defend me
at all times.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If Master Roy orders it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
I am ordering you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I may object, my lady, I cannot
follow those orders even if they[A]
are from you.[A]
A knight must serve his master,
and only his master.[A]
One who forgets that can no longer
be called a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I know that![A]
I was just testing your loyalty
as a knight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my lady.
Forgive my rudeness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Well, anyway, you have passed
the test.[A]
Be proud of it![A]
[0335]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x103]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you are not my knight...[A]
It is true that we are a princess and
a knight, am I correct?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]T-Then...[A]
I shall hereby permit you to kiss
my hand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, thank you, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lance, you do understand, do you not?[A]
This is to make clear the difference
in our status.[A]
There is no more meaning to it than
that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Of course...[A]
You could be a little more...
disappointed...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something,
my lady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No!
Nothing![A]
[0336]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me? Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you dressing yourself
in men's clothes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it strange...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course!
A lady must be wearing elegant dresses.[A]
A true lady must be dressed properly[A]
when they fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really...?
No, I suppose you're right.[A]
I don't know anything about
such matters...
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well then, I suppose I can
teach you everything I know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? N-No![A]
I wouldn't do well in such things...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous!
A lady must always be beautiful.[A]
No gentleman will ever at you
if you look like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]D-Do you think so...[A]
Well...she is offering to help me...
All right![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please teach me, Lady Clarine!

[0337]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]So...
Dorothy, what do you usually do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm pretty busy outside
the battlefield.[A]
I help cook meals and stuff...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?![A]
You can leave dirty jobs like
that to that lowly Merlinus person![A]
[OpenMidRight]L-Lowly?
Master Merlinus is lowly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How do you take care of
your hair?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wash it with water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What!?
I can't believe it...![A]
Here, use this.[A]
You must wash your hair with it
[ToggleSmile]three times a day![A]
Understood?
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]T-Three times?[A]
Well...
It looks really expensive...[A]
I appreciate it, but it would
be wasteful if I used it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you saying!
I am offering it to you.[A]
Go ahead, take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Well, thank you, then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Also...
You should change the way you speak.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Could you not speak more like me,
with a refined and elegant tone?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...okay...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, what a beautiful day it is![A]
[ToggleSmile]Would you care for a cup of tea
and crumpets?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This will take a lot of work...
Well, first, you must learn how[A]
to take care of your hair, how
to choose your dresses, dance[A]
steps, how to turn down offers
from men...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That much!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.
You mustn't give up so easily![A]
The way to a refined lady
is a tough one indeed![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[0338]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...[A]
Nothing seems to have changed.[A]
No one seems to be noticing.
So maybe I should just give up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry!
I know you were just trying to help me...[A]
But it's not your fault![A]
You know, with me, the base isn't very
good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy![A]
That is what's wrong with you![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen to me.[A]
A fine lady must have confidence in herself.[A]
No matter how much you dress up, if you do
not have faith in yourself, it will all be[A]
in vain.[A]
You must not degrade yourself like that.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have confidence in yourself!
It is me who is teaching you.[A]
Of course you will
become a fine lady one day![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, thank you,
Lady Clarine...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...And...[A]
We are friends now,
[ToggleSmile]are we not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me 'Lady' Clarine.
Just call me Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.
Okay then, thanks, Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A-Ahem!
Today we shall go over how to drink tea![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right![A]

[OpenMidRight]...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Fa?
...What are you looking at...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You grew up a little.[A]
[OpenMidRight]R-Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
Why, why?
Fa always stay the same![A]
You were the same as Fa before![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
I am half Dragon...
so I grow slowly...[A]
But you... grow even
more slowly than me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why does Fa stay little?
Why doesn't she grow up like you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are a full-blooded Dragon...[A]
A Dragon's lifespan...is close to
eternity...[A]
I have human blood in me...so I
grow at a different speed than you...[A]
Do you understand...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand...[A]
When you grow up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When will Fa grow up?
Soon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yay![A]
[033A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D]

[OpenMidLeft]Hmmmm...[A]
Sophia, when is Fa gonna
grow up?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa's not growing at all...
Fa wants to be a grown up![A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
You can live...for a very long time...[A]
Even when I become old and die...you
will still live on...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
No! No no no!
You won't die![A]
Nooooo!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Waaaaah...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa...I'm sorry...
Don't cry...[A]
I feel the same way you do...[A]
But...[A]
That is what it means...
to live for eternity.[A]
[033B]

[OpenMidLeft]Sophia?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa was scared that you would grow up and
not want to play with her anymore...[A]
Fa always wants to be with you!
Fa wants to play hide-and-seek and tag[A]
[ToggleSmile]and lots of other fun games.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa...[A]
Don't worry...
I'll always...be your friend...[A]
I'll always be with you...
All right...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really!? Yay![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
We'll always...
be together...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene![A]
Look, look!
A butterfly!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa, shouldn't you be doing
something else?[A]
Didn't Master Roy give you
an order to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy's orders are no fun.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa, you should be doing
what you're told.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aww...[A]
But Fa doesn't want to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Er...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Say sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa's sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, Fa.[A]
You promised Roy you would
do what he asked, right?[A]
If you make a promise,
you have to keep it.[A]
Okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good girl.[A]
Well then, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[033D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B]
[OpenMidRight]Come here, Fa.
I'll braid your hair for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you like having
your hair touched, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes![A]
...Igrene,
is Fa gonna get pretty?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
You have such lovely hair...[A]
You'll become very, very beautiful
when you grow up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A]
Hey, Igrene?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fa, hold still.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What's wrong?[A]
Do your hands hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry...[A]
I was just remembering my daughter.[A]
She was a very attractive little girl,
much like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened to her?[A]
[OpenMidRight]She's gone...
She went to a faraway place.[A]
[033E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were talking about your
little girl the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She came to play with Fa.[A]
When Fa was all alone in her room,
she came with Sophia to play and[A]
and tell Fa about the outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]She said you were the
'Guardian'.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
She stopped coming to play
with Fa.[A]
Fa asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.[A]
Is it Fa's fault?[A]
Was Fa a bad girl to her?[A]
Did Fa make her angry and
go to the faraway place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...that's not the case.
She was never mad at you, Fa.[A]
She just can't play with you
anymore, but...[A]
She'll always be very fond of
of you, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...of course.[A]
[033F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106]
[OpenMidLeft]La la laaa...
Oh! It's Sue![A]
[OpenMidRight]You look like you're having
lots of fun, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes,[A]
Fa's having lots
and lots of fun![A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that what's fun?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
Fa was never allowed
to play outside before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Never...?
You always stayed indoors?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]La la la laa...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Always inside...[A]
She never knew the blessing of the
sky or the warmth of the Earth...[A]
[0340]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]Sue![A]
[OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can Fa ride on your horse
some time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My horse?
Of course, you can ride her now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not now.
Roy told Fa not to bug the others![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
There's a place Fa wants to go
on the horse![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A place with lots of pretty flowers![A]
Or a place where the sun's shining
and it's all nice and warm![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...All right.
We'll go sometime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yay!
Thank you, Sue![A]

of other places, too![A]
Fa wants to learn more
about the big outside world.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Once this war is over, we can
go to many different places.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
There are many things in this world
that have been nurtured by the Sky's[A]
blessings and the Earth's warmth.
We can go see all those things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmmm...[A]
Fa doesn't get it.
[OpenMidRight]You'll understand when you get a
little older.[A]
I know you will.[A]
[0342]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]La la laaa la...[A]
Oh...[A][Clear]
A flower![A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][ToggleSmile]So that is a Dragon...
Mankind's archenemy...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But something's...
strange...[A]
The Dragons in the old scrolls
weren't like that at all.[A]
They were much more...
inhuman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-Me?
...I am Niime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Niime?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right...[A]
Oh, I must be off.
I had things to do.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[0343]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124]
[OpenMidRight]Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Granny Niime![A]
[OpenMidRight]Granny, eh...[A]
You're actually several hundred
years older than I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, no matter.[A]
Fa,
take a look at this gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived on this land.[A]
The demons used their immense power
to destroy the humans.[A]
The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...[A]
And then one day...[A]
Eight bright columns of light were
born that would defeat the demons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were they pretty lights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...The humans used the lights to
fight against the demons.[A]
After a long and devastating battle...
the demons were finally defeated.[A]
But that wasn't the end...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Mmm... ... ...[A]
Fa's all sleepy now...[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]So...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]This is the enemy of mankind, eh?[A]
She doesn't seem to have a worry
in the world...[A]
...How cute...[A]
[0344]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]Granny Niime![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, hello, Fa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...[A]
I told you the story of men
and demons the other day, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah!
The pretty lights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To tell you the truth...
I was afraid of those demons.[A]
After I studied dark magic and
mankind's history...only then[A]
did I discover just how powerful
and terrifying the demons were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
After meeting you, my fear seems to
have just gone right out the window.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's nothing.[A]
Well, my long stories must be
boring you.[A]
Here.[A]
Go play with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What a fool I was...[A]
I was willing to do terrible things
to an innocent little girl for the[A]
peace and safety of our race...[A]
What was I thinking...[A]
There's no point in peace obtained
[ToggleSmile]through such hideous measures.[A]
[0345]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]?
...Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!
Ummm...[A]
What's that thing there?
It's making pretty noises.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is a harp.
Do you like how it sounds?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah!
Fa really likes it![A]
And...What's your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Elphin,
my cute little lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Elf...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elphin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elphin![A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa likes you too, Elphin![A]
Your hair blows in the wind, and it's like
gold when the sun's all shining on it![A]
Fa likes pretty things like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it is an honor.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can Fa come and see you again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.
Any time.[A]
[0346]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Elphin![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, the cute little lady from the
other day.[A]
Hello.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fa's name's not 'cute little lady'![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, pardon me.
Then...may I call you Miss Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa's name's not 'Missfa'!
It's Fa![A]
[OpenMidRight]As you wish, Fa.
Fa...the name has a unique feel to it.[A]
Is it your real name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Fa's real name is verrrrrry long.[A]
But they say it's a sound humans
can't hear.[A]
Fa's the only part that you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But maybe you could hear it, Elphin![A]
You make so many pretty sounds,
maybe you could hear Fa's real name![A]
[OpenMidRight]Shall we try some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah![A]
[0347]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Elphin?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, what is it, Fa?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa always wanted
to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?
I hope I can give you an answer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ummmm...
[ToggleSmile]Are you a girl or a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Which do you think?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fa thought you were a girl
at first cause you're so pretty[A]
and you smell real nice![A]
But then Roy said the other day
that you were a man...[A]
So that makes you a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am a boy.
...Were you disappointed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope!
...Sooo, you're a boy...[A]
Heehee...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Fa's gonna get as pretty
as you when she grows up.[A]
So wait till then, kay?
Promise![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Fa! Wait![A][......]
[ToggleSmile]...I seriously doubt that I will still
be alive by the time she grows up...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose I should let it go for now.[A]
[0348]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shin...[A]
I'm sorry I put you through
such a difficult task.[A]
I must thank you for
finding my granddaughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was nothing, Chief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It must not have been an easy journey.
Where did you go after you left us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]After we lost the battle,
I set out looking for Lady Sue.[A]
I traversed through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.[A]
That is where I found her.
It was several months[A]
after you gave me the order.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
It has been a long time
since we lost that battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chief...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We lost many of our clansmen.
...Young ones, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you have survived, Chief.[A]
No matter how separated the clan is
you can bring us back together.[A]

[0349]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The nations in the west,
such as Lycia and Etruria,[A]
were very different from Sacae.[A]
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would not allow arrows to pass.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I would imagine.[A]
In the vast plains of Sacae,
horses are crucial.[A]
However, in more crowded areas,
key points are defended by soldiers[A]
such as the ones you speak of.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Betrayal and trickery are but
mere tactics to them.[A]
It is only us who think that
such methods are dirty.[A]
It is no surprise we lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But...[A]
I cannot agree with such
...dirty fighting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must accept the fact that
people use it, though.[A]
We must be prepared for it when it
is used on us.[A]
[034A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our Father the Sky has not only
brought us misfortune.[A]
Some good things happened
after we lost.[A]
Especially for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The land isn't as it used to be.[A]
We of Sacae must think with broader
perspectives outside of the clans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Chief...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have learned much
during your travels.[A]
I'm already too old to change my way
of thinking.[A]
But you are still young.[A]
It is your responsibility to lead
Sacae to a brighter future.[A]
This is an order from your Chief, Shin.[A]
It is up to you youths to decide Sacae's
fate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[034B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Sue, please step back.[A]
It's not wise to linger around the front.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shin, this is a battlefield.
I have to go up front to fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will do the fighting.[A]
You must think of your safety.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My archery skills have gotten much
better than before.[A]
I'm sure I can be of help to the army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have orders from the Silver Wolf
to keep you safe.[A]
I will not allow you to put yourself
in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.
I will do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sound like Grandpa
when you argue with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
The Silver Wolf is whom I respect
the most.[A]
[034C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Sue, you're still staying up
front, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand your concern, but I can't
be sitting around doing nothing, either.[A]
I can't stand simply watching the others
fight while I hide in safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I do understand how you feel.[A]
But Lady Sue, please don't
push yourself over the limit.[A]
You are the clan's last hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then that is more the reason
I should go up front and fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That depends on the place and time.[A]
Not everyone will follow somebody just
because he is fighting in the front lines.[A]
Lady Sue, we have a goal.[A]
We must gather our people and reconstruct
the Kutolah clan.[A]
Please do not forget that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't want you to push yourself
over the limit to protect me, either.[A]
I am not the only one working to
reconstruct the clan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.
I shall remember that, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you.
Do you promise not to stress yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[034D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shin, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is the matter, Lady Sue?
You don't look well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I heard you were ambushed...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not hurt, my Lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Shin, I want you to retreat to the
back lines.[A]
I will take over for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying, Lady Sue?
It should be the other way around![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've made up my mind.
You're going to step back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retreat to the back lines, Shin!
This is an order.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Everyone...
They were all killed by Bern...[A]
I couldn't even track down the traitor
in our ranks, and...they were all killed,[A]
right in front of my eyes...[A]
I was helpless, Shin.[A]
I don't want that feeling again.
I don't want to lose you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Sue...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must not die before I do.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was ordered to protect you, Lady Sue.
There is no way I would leave you and die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you promise?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.[A]
[034E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You're...
Shin, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You joined this army, too?
What a coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
It is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
Um...oh.[A]
Did you find the woman you
were looking for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I-I'm sorry...
Maybe I shouldn't have asked...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
That's not it.
I was able to meet her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you did?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
It is.[A]
[034F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Shin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I hadn't asked you yet.
Which clan are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you from the Bulgar clan?[A]
Or are you part of the Djute
clan that betrayed us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
Was that...
a joke?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-No, it wasn't.[A]
I lived with my parents so I don't
really know much about the clans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, you're from the Kutolah clan, right?
You said so before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
Our chief is the Silver Wolf,
the strongest warrior in Sacae.[A]
No one can match his mastery of
the sword and bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You admire him greatly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can you tell?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can tell by your eyes.
You're usually foreboding...[A]
I, I mean quiet...[A]
But you had a proud look on your
face just now.[A]
[0350]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...strange.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I am?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacaean women rarely pick up weapons.
Even if they do, they would choose a bow.[A]
You would rarely see a girl pick up a sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And...[A]
Sacaean people worship the
Sky and Earth.[A]
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...[A]
I have never seen a Sacaean like
you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.[A]
People can also live freely like you...
You've taught me a lesson.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think you're exaggerating...[A]
But it feels nice to hear you
say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have beautiful eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you're looking
straight ahead at your dream of[A]
mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray that your dream will
come true one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
Thank you![A]
[0351]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
......[A][Clear]
......[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleMouthMove]...Sigh...[A]
Why am I hiding here?
I want to talk to him, but...[A]
He's a little...forbidding.[A]
I'd like him to teach me how
to improve my bow skills.[A]
But how can I talk to him?
Well... maybe some other time...[A]
[0352]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C]Hello, Shin!
My name is Dorothy.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...A little too intrusive?[A]
Would you like to have an archery
duel?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But I don't want to compete
with him.[A]
[ToggleSmile]What a nice bow!
Where did you buy it?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...No, that doesn't sound right
at all.[A]
Hmm... this is tough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, I know![A]
I can bring him some food that he
likes...[A]
Wait, I don't know what kind of
food he likes...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I like fruit, but what about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...well...
What can I do? ...[A]
[0353]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
...But why am I worrying so much
over him?[A]
...I can't figure that out, either.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I have to figure out a way to talk
to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, um...er...
[ToggleSmile]H-Hello![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, hello...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, wh...what...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-What...what...kind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What food of kind you do like?
...... ...Shoot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind of food do I like, right?
I like fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...
...Did you hear me talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to listen with
such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to talk to me,
then don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We're in the same army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[0354]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x12A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you doing, shooting at me!
I'm on your side![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh, right.
You were.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, right!?[A]
It's fatal for a Dragon Knight to get
shot with an arrow.[A]
Watch it, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]So, he's looking at me like an enemy.[A]
Well, I suppose it can't be helped,
considering what Bern did to Sacae.[A]
But we can't be quarreling among allies...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Well...[ToggleMouthMove]
I guess I should do something about it.[A]
[0355]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Hey, Shin!
How are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fine, as you can see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're really great with your bow, huh?
You're hitting almost all of your targets.[A]
I'd like to as well, but I'm kinda...[......]
!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look out![MoveLeft]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenLeft]...Hm.
I missed his throat.[MoveMidLeft][A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought I killed him...
Sorry...[A]
I made you clean up after
my mistake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter.
You still saved my life.[A]
Hey, why don't you teach me some
tips on how to make my attacks[A]
more accurate?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]...Oh, well,
at least he helped me out...[A]
[0356]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][.....][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][ToggleSmile]Shin!
Behind you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]![A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you all right?[A]
I guess even you have some trouble
when you're surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I saw it.
It was an automatic reaction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'll be going now.[A]
Make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't make that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did the other day![A]
...Well, we're in heated action, so it
can't be helped if you occasionally[A]
make a mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point my
bow at an ally.[A]
...There's no way I would shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you missed to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[0357]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sue?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I must apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because you couldn't get all
of our clansmen to escape?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]There was a traitor among us.
It couldn't be helped.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, it could.
I am the granddaughter of the Silver Wolf.[A]
I had to be able to lead our clansmen to
safety, no matter what the situation.[A]
But, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm the one who gave you those orders.
It is my responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you abandon your fellow
clansmen and flee all on your own?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Never![A]
When the enemy appeared, I rushed at them
to make time for our people to escape.[A]
But that was a decoy...[A]
The enemies main forces were stationed
right where everyone fled to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
You did your best.[A]
I'm sure you can't forget it so easily,
but you must at least get over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...I'll try.[A]
[0358]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue,
are you feeling better now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I see you're still suffering over it.[A]
Well, I suppose you can't get over it
that easily...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I just let our people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sue, let's go out for a
long ride after this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A long ride?
In a time like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Especially in a time like this.[A]
You could get yourself killed fighting
with other things occupying your mind.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must listen more carefully to the
voice of the Sky and Earth.[A]
We humans are but tiny creatures compared
to the size of the great Sky and Earth.[A]
Haven't I always been telling you this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I am listening...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, you are only listening to your
own voice.[A]
We're leaving for a while after this
battle.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'll do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good girl.[A]
[0359]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]You look a lot better now,
Sue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I still can't forget that I couldn't rescue
our fellow clansmen, but I've decided not to[A]
dwell on the past.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll look forward towards the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it seems that you've learned
something from our ride the other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was able to listen to a lot of
nature's voices for a change.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![A]
[ToggleSmile]I couldn't stand seeing you look
so distressed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had such a look on my face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others wouldn't know,
but I would.[A]
I'm your grandfather.
I've known you ever since you were born.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...
Grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was only doing my duty...
as your grandpa.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
[035A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right,
where's the next enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]?
[ToggleSmile]Do you need something, Sue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You use a bow, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why don't you ride
on a horse?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?
Well...[A]
I've always fought like this,
on my feet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Isn't it hard to fight on the ground?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]
I mean, I think it would be harder
trying to shoot from horseback.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, Sue?
[ToggleSmile]...What was that all about?[A]
[035B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh hi, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still think it's better
on horseback.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
...Do you mean about fighting with a bow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and step back from your target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm sure it's up each his own...[A]
Wait, did you actually get off your
horse and try shooting from the ground?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't know unless I actually try.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But that's dangerous![A]
If you do something you're not used to
during battle, you'll get yourself killed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not in battle.[A]
I was just shooting at some trees
during our break.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you for being concerned
about me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're allies in the same army,
right?[A]
[035C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wolt?[A]
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Geez, it sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...[A]
I mean, remember how you said it was easier
to keep up with your target on horseback?[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You tried it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wouldn't know unless I actually try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How did you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you can't beat a horse's speed.[A]
Still, I think it's more stable on foot, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought it was dangerous to try something
you're not used to in battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
Well, I only tried it for a little bit.
So it's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want to take advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Although, I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shoot very well?[A]
I probably wouldn't even be able to stay on!
Yeah...[A]
I think I should stay on the ground.
It seems to be more fit for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hehehe.
Perhaps you're right.[A]
[035D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110]
[OpenMidRight]Are you Dayan,
the Silver Wolf?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are not a Sacaean,
yet you know my name...[A]
Where did you hear about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once in the past,
I treated a wounded Sacaean.[A]
That is when I heard about the
unmatched warrior of Sacae.[A]
I was expecting someone with
white hair like mine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The name 'Silver Wolf'
comes from our ancestors.[A]
Our legends say that our
ancestors were wolves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you need something from me?[A]
If you wish to preach, I already
have a deity to worship.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No,
I did not come to preach.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Are you sure?
Do you not have to serve your god?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, my mission is to guide
those in need of direction.[A]
But you Sacaeans already have the
sky and earth to worship.[A]
God would not approve of me
pushing my beliefs on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[035E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We Sacaeans pray to the sky and the earth.[A]
The light of day and the darkness of night
that engulfs this land...[A]
They produce wind, lightning, fire, ice,
and many other affinities...[A]
Every person on this planet is protected
by one of the elements.[A]
According to my clan's beliefs, I am
protected by the Anima affinity.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see.
Interesting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Elimine Church has similar beliefs.[A]
When the creator made man, he blessed
them all with one of the seven affinities[A]
However...those elements...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Those elements hold no power
on their own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.
...Interesting, indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
Perhaps...[A]
This is one of the truths of
the creation of our world.[A]
[035F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The seven affinities...[A]
Their effects will only appear
through bonds with other people.[A]
When your heart is linked with
someone else's...[A]
That is when the elements reveal
their true power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Saint Elimine also said to cherish
your relationships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I wonder if we have been able to
link our hearts with each other.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am sure we have.[A]
We have yet to find out
what effects it has...[A]
[0360]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...[A]
What's that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
Have you not seen eastern bows before?
This is a bow we use for training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]C-Can I see?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, here.
Try pulling the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you're incredibly strong.[A]
A normal man wouldn't be able
to pull it at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I so strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now,
try shooting the arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]H-Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, you put an arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Put arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now let go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let go...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Argh.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales![A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Arrow hit me...[A]
[0361]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let me see your head.[A]
Yes...
It looks fine now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
No more bow for me.[A]
What's that horse?
Strange hair color.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it looks different from the horses
where you come from, doesn't it?[A]
We can survive in Sacae thanks to
these horses.[A]
We have no trouble keeping up with the
mounts that knights ride, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I want to ride...[A]
[Clear]Gah.[MoveFarFarRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales![A]
Are you all right?[A]
Horses are very sensitive to people
standing behind them.[A]
You have to be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Ow...[A]
[0362]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Gonzales.[A]
It seems that whenever you are with
me, you get injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here,
I'll give you this as an apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.[A]
It would suit a fine warrior like
you nicely.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this as well.[A]
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I happy.[A]
I drink.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait,
don't...drink so much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
Uhhhhhhhh?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzales!
Can you get up?[A]
This wine is very strong.[A]
You shouldn't drink so much of
it at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhhhhh...[A]
[0363]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're the Silver Wolf...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you are a warrior of Sacae, too.
What is your name?[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
..I was at Bulgar.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]Bulgar...[A]
So you survived.[A]
I heard that most of the clans
there were decimated...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]That time...[A]
I learned that it is the law of
nature that the weak die out.[A]
That is the same anywhere,
whether it be Sacae, or Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...
Is that the reason why you are here?[A]
To become strong and have your
you revenge on Bern...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0364]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
You said that you fight
for revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What will you do after
you have your revenge?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am asking you...[A]
After you avenge your clan,
what will you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You have no right to know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you dedicate your life...
to revenge?[A]
Is that all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You want me to just keep quiet, even
after seeing my entire clan killed?[A]
...But you have suffered the same.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is not what I am saying.[A]
We are men of Sacae.[A]
We must make those who desecrate
our land pay.[A]
However...even if we do win this
war and destroy Bern, those that[A]
we lost will still not return.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You cannot regain what you have
lost through revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know no other way to live.[A]
[0365]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
What will you do after this war is over?
Do you have a place to go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So I thought.[A]
Then would you join the
Kutolah clan?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Our clan has lost,
but we haven't been destroyed.[A]
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once again.[A]
It would be helpful if you were
there with us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't take offers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not an offer.[A]
I am asking you because I have
faith in your strength as a warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hm...
Difficult person, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I shall say no more.[A]
But always remember that if you
ever change your mind, we will[A]
welcome you with open arms.[A]
Keep that in mind...
wherever you go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Yeah.[A]
[0366]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Barth.
I haven't thanked you yet, have I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanked me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You came to rescue me,
remember?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that.[A]
I was just fulfilling my duty
as a knight, my lady.[A]
In fact, I must apologize that we
couldn't get to you earlier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Barth...
I'm sorry.[A]
I can never give you anything
in return...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know.
Here, take this necklace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, please.[A]
We do not fight for reward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You were safe.[A]
That in itself is reward enough,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Barth...[A]
[0367]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Barth.[A]
Do you remember Devias and
Leygance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All I know is that they were making
contact with Bern to start a rebellion.[A]
However, the rumors that I have heard
about them are all bad.[A]
I understand that they were using their
position as generals to illegally collect[A]
money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The rebellion was being planned
even before Bern invaded.[A]
Ashtor has found proof of that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I was foolish.[A]
They were both my fathers' knights, so...
I didn't want to suspect them.[A]
I wanted to trust them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the trust is what
put you in danger...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know...
I'm truly sorry, Barth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina,
please value your safety above all.[A]
You are our master, and we knights
depend on you to pledge our loyalty.[A]
[0368]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barth...[A]
What do you think will happen
to Ostia now, without my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Unless someone rebuilds Ostia after this
war is done, it will fall further and[A]
further into chaos.[A]
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
I don't think I'm qualified.[A]
I'm just going to be a
nuisance to you all...[A]
You...think so too,
right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know not how a person in power
should be, but...[A][Clear]
When you said that you wanted to trust
your servants, I certainly did not[A]
feel that you were mistaken in
thinking so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I have one thing to say to you,
my lady.[A]
No matter what kind of path that
you would follow from now on,[A]
we knights will swear our
loyalty to always support you.[A]
[0369]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidLeft]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Barth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have you been keeping
up with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I've been wanting to asking you,
but why did you not try to become[A]
an Armor Knight?[A]
Why did you become a Mercenary?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I figured heavy armor wouldn't
suit me very well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is because you are not
training yourself hard enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, but I wasn't born with...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is the perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day from now on.[A]
Then you may be able to become an
Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
[036A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth...
This training is just...crazy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll get used to it soon enough.[A]
I do this everyday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't have the
build that you do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just keep quiet and
train yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[036B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]?[A]
Is someone doing practice swings...?[A]
[ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116]
[OpenMidRight]Phew...[A]
I wonder if I've gotten any closer
to Sir Barth now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108]Oujay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Woah!?[A]
Oh, Sir Barth!
You scared me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good,
very good.[A]
You see, your body has
gotten used to training itself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel like I just have to keep
moving my body.[A]
And besides, I would hate to lose someone
because I wasn't strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[A]
If you keep a habit of training yourself,
you will never get tired in battle.[A]
It doesn't matter whether you are an
Armor Knight or Mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
But I thought you wanted to
make me an Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just said that to make you train
as a habit.[A]
I know your build wouldn't be able
to handle heavy armor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It encouraged you more,
didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It did?
I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What did you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing...[A]
[036C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Ah, Barth.
It's been a long time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it has.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It seems that you have become
stronger since you left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They were tough battles indeed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I wasn't just sitting around
in Ostia, either.[A]
I was training myself at the arena,
preparing myself for when a battle[A]
breaks out.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That arena.[A]
Sorry for saying this, but...
I really don't approve of it.[A]
A knight, fighting to make money?
That's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one has a need for
a weak Armor Knight.[A]
I will keep training myself
to prevail in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
You haven't changed at all, I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither have you.[A]
[036D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barth...
Was it all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did you not want to go into battle
alongside Lord Hector?[A]
After all, you were always saying that
a knight's true purpose is to go out[A]
and fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It would be a lie to say I didn't
feel that way.[A]
But I figured staying here and protecting
protecting this land and Lady Lilina[A]
would be a form of battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I allowed Lady Lilina into the
hands of the enemy.[A]
I was naive...[A]
Somewhere at the bottom of my
heart, I believed Ostia was at peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't blame yourself...
You need to fix that part of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I do...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, whenever I talk to you, it seems
that I reveal my inner feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We've been friends ever since we
we were knighted.[A]
Even if we try to hide something,
we could easily see through it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Haha...
Exactly.[A]
[036E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ask me what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why did you want to become an
Armor Knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because I wanted to protect those
I love with this armor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What about you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I became an Armor Knight because
they are strongest fighters.[A]
I believe that in a 1 on 1 battle, no
other unit can match the Armor Knight.[A]
...Which is probably why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina against a large horde...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That happened because I wasn't
strong enough.[A]
If I had enough power to stop the
rebellion all on my own,[A]
I would not have allowed the situation
to get out of hand.[A]
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Then you are to become a spear
stronger than any other.[A]
And I shall become a shield tougher
than any other.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A spear and a shield...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let us together make the way for the
lives that we shall lead in the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds good, friend![A]
[036F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight]Sir Barth!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I would never lose to such puny
enemies like these.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't ask you if you're safe,
either.[A]
We Ostian knights will never lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad that you're looking out for me,
but you should be concerned about yourself[A]
before worrying about others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[0370]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter, Wendy?
You're panting.[A]
An Ostian knight wouldn't be heaving
after a light battle like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember our training, Wendy![A]
Don't you remember how we marched
full-speed over the that mountain?[A]
This nothing compared to that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Show the enemy...
the wrath of the Ostian knights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
I will![A]
[0371]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barth,
how can I improve my skills further?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're already a full-fledged
Ostian knight, Wendy.[A]
I don't have anything to
criticize you for.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you![A]
But...
Sir Barth...[A]
Can you...
say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um...[A]
I'm sure there is something
I need to work on, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
From now on,
you must judge your own self.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I want you to teach me more...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't...
Don't leave me, Sir Barth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?
What are you talking about?[A]
We are now comrades
fighting together.[A]
I wouldn't just leave you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
...We have wasted enough time
talking like this.[A]
Let's get moving, Wendy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![A]
[0372]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is no surprise, but Bern
seems to have been doing something[A]
behind the scenes even before the
war started.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
The traitors in the Alliance, the
rebellion at Ostia...[A]
It all happened according to their plans.
Well of course, I can't say much because[A]
I didn't realize when it mattered the
most...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The betrayals in the Alliance,
and Lord Hector's death...[A]
We are all to blame for that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nah, it's my fault.[A]
The mistake I made, it was just...
It was just way too big.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We must keep our eyes sharp so that such
a tragedy does not happen in the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I know.
Traitors and spies could be anywhere.[A]
Like in this army, for example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...![A]
There is a traitor in our ranks!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
Not that I know of.[A]
But you can never be too careful.[A]
I carved that concept into my
heart when Lord Hector was killed.[A]
[0373]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Asthor, about the other day...
About the traitor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have any suspects?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not yet.[A]
But I need all the information I can
get, so I'm doing some research in[A]
the shadows.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Traitors...
If you think of the possibilities...[A]
The list keeps getting longer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.[A]
I'll have to go through them
individually one by one...[A]
This'll be a tough job.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most obvious suspect
would be her...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right.
Guinevere, Princess of Bern.[A]
You can't help but suspect her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Roy trusts her.
I really don't to think that she...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We would lose any trust our comrades
had for us when they find out we are[A]
suspecting them..[A]
[OpenMidRight]......
It's tough, ain't it?[A]
But someone's got to do it.[A]
[0374]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
...How did it go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
It took some time, but
I'm much more confident.[A]
The princess is innocent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinevere really
trusts General Roy.[A]
So does everyone else here.
Well, what do you know...[A]
This ragtag group's bond is
pretty strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
I'm relieved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.
So that's taken care of.[A]
When we get someone new, I'll
be sure to keep an eye on him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry to have to give all
this dirty work to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.[A]
[0375]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
Has something been bothering you
lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh...
No, everything's fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
I have been given special orders by
Lord Hector to protect you at all costs.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So if something has happened, I should
know about it so I can protect you well..[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I said, nothing's wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight]B-But you wouldn't be so...
touchy in your normal state...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Touchy!?
I'm not being touchy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just be quiet, Bors!
You're annoying me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-Where are you going, my lady?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someplace where I won't
have to listen to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina![A]
[0376]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, uh...
About the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You were just being concerned for me,
and I just blew up at you like that...[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please...don't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Will you hear why I'm so irritated?
I think I need someone to talk to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If I would suffice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's about Roy...
What do you think about him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
I think he has grown splendidly well to
to be a wise and caring leader to us all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Roy I know would have
mismatched buttons on his suit,[A]
and he wouldn't be able to do
one dance step properly...[A]
So I always thought I had to
take care of him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]But Roy's suddenly changing.
He's gotten so...grown up, you know?[A]
He seems like such a faraway person
now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...My lady, Master Roy has not changed
as much as you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is true that he has grown and matured,
but that does not change the nature of[A]
the person.[A]
Master Roy's nature is still the same
as you know it to be, my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's right...
Thank you for listening to me, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, my lady.[A]
[0377]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]You look much better today,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I feel much better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is good to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like Roy was avoiding me or
anything...[A]
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I was getting left behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was just jumping to conclusions
and fretting over nothing...[A]
Once I realized that, it suddenly
seemed so silly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm still a kid, aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, will you always stay
by my side from now on?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I am a knight,
and my loyalty is with you.[A]
I shall always be there for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors...[A]
[0378]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-Oh!
Hello, Wendy.[A]
What a, uh, coincidence![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is good to see that you are well.
Did you need something, brother?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
I didn't.[A]
I was just walking around, and
I ran into you, yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you hurt?
Is your armor too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am fine, brother.
Well, I must be off...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're going already?
You could rest awhile longer...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you for your consideration,
but I really must be off.[A]
The battle is starting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes, of course...
Of course you should.[A]
[0379]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Wendy...
Just running in to you like this...[A]
Pure coincidence, yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something...
wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, no no, nothing.[A]
Well, since we've met again like this,
why don't we stop and talk a little?[A]
Well, are you hurt?[A]
Is your armor not too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
Thanks for your consideration.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you taking care of your
spear and your helmet well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you eating properly?[A]
Do you have any worries that you
want to talk about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Have you made a lot of friends?
Any boyfriends...[A]
[037A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa, W-Wendy!
We certainly meet a lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, brother.
Did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.
Just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am really grateful for your
consideration all the time.[A]
But I am a knight of Ostia.[A]
I'm training myself so I can
become like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I want to become strong, I can't
be depending on you all the time.[A]
I'm going to be fine, really, so
please don't worry...[A]
I must be off.[A]
...I'm really grateful for you,
brother.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
...I see...[A]
She's grown so much.[A]
I suppose I was the one...
being childish...[A][Clear]
Wendy, I wish you luck.[A]
[037B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Yo, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor...
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, nothing's the matter.
I just wanted to say hi.[A]
Hahaha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove]
This smell...[A]
Are you drinking?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yeah. I was bored so I
decided to have a little one...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bored?
We are in the middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, all I can do is open chests and
doors...[A]
I can't fight at all.[A]
Well, I'll leave the fighting to you
and be on my way...[A]
Sorry to bother you.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[037C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Bors.
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor...[A]
I think you should...refrain
a little from your drinking.[A]
There are others watching, and
you are setting a bad example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...
about Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I heard there was a traitor in
the Lycia Alliance...[A]
If I'd gotten off my lazy ass and
had been doing my job properly,[A]
that wouldn't have happened...
Lord Hector would never have lost...[A]
As...long as he had the right
information...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]It is not your
fault.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And, you know...
The rebellion.[A]
It was obvious that it was going
to break out...[A]
And still, I couldn't do anything...[A]
Heh, talk about being totally
worthless...[A]
You all must feel sorry for
Lord Hector...[A]
Having such a useless spy like me...[A]
Haha... ha...
[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Damn...
I'm out of booze...[A]
[037D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eh...?
Oh, Bors.[A]
Come on,
have a drink with me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop blaming yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We lost Lord Hector.
The responsibility lies in all of us.[A]
But... Still...
We must not look back to the past.[A]
We must move forward.[A]
We have to make the dream that Lord
Hector couldn't fulfill come true.[A]
And we need you for that, Ashtor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You... why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you...defend a drunken,
useless wretch like me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is because you are
a knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A knight?
Who...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Although you have not
been officially knighted...[A]
You fought with your life to
defend Lord Hector.[A]
That is more than enough
to make you a loyal knight.[A]
At least, I would think so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove].....[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Bo..rs... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ashtor, let us walk the path...
[CloseSpeechFast]and fulfill the dream of our master.[A]
[037E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors?
You are Sir Bors, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Oujay of Ostia's Armor Knights.
I have heard of you from Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, from her...
So you are our newest member?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.
I'm pleased to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But... you don't seem fit to be
an Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I figured that would fill in the
parts that our squad is lacking in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see.
That's very noble of you.[A]
Not many can do the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[037F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I heard from Sir Barth, that you
have even beaten him once, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Just once, in a martial arts
tournament held in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What was the battle like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
To tell the truth, I actually don't
remember very well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
Was the battle with Sir Barth so
boring that you don't even remember?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not it.[A]
It was because I don't fight for the
sake of fighting.[A]
That time I was forced to participate, and I
wasn't interested in the tournament itself.[A]
So I've already forgotten most of what
happened in it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oujay, there must always be
a cause in battle.[A]
You must never fight for the
sake of fighting.[A]
[0380]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors, you said the other day that
there must always be a cause in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
And for that cause, you must be willing
to go through any and all hardships.[A]
Do you have such a cause?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...
Unfortunately, I don't.[A]
I became a mercenary to feed
my family.[A]
So I don't really have a cause...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've got one right there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Feeding your family is a great cause.[A]
And for that cause, you train yourself
and become stronger, stronger than[A]
anyone else.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]A cause is not just limited to
large scale things like defending[A]
your country or saving the world.[A]
All right?[A]
[0381]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD]
[OpenMidLeft]Hello, Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...
Please stay close to me.[A]
I shall protect you with my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Th-Thank you...[A]
That armor...
It's quite an accomplishment.[A]
Isn't it heavy for a girl?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, my lady.[A]
The weight of a knight's armor
is the symbol of his loyalty.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right...
But just don't strain yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you very much,
my lady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why did you become an Armor Knight?
Did you want to become like Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
My brother is the goal that I pursue.[A]
I wish to protect you like my
brother does, Lady Lilina.[A]
[0382]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidLeft]Wendy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's chat a little.
Tell me about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I am an Armor Knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not things like that...[A]
For example, do you have a
man whom you fancy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A...man?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I... don't really know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I always just focused on becoming
strong like my brother, so...[A]
I never really thought about
things like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's talk about something else then.[A]
We're both girls in the same army that
grew up in the same place.[A]
I want to know about you.[A]
[0383]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Odd?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are in a much higher position
than we are...[A]
But you still come right down to talk
to us with a smile on you face.[A]
It seems...odd.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?
I just want to be friends with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]F-Friends?[A]
I don't think that would be
possible, my lady..[A]
You are my master![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't make a difference.[A]
You're the only girl around my age
that grew up in the same area.[A]
Let's not worry about who's the
master or the servant...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina![A]
You are carrying Ostia's future
on your shoulders.[A]
You are different from us.[A]
You do understand, do you not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...So we can't be friends?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
But I am very grateful for
your consideration.[A]
Perhaps we cannot be friends,[A]
but would you allow me to go over
and chat with you once in awhile?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
...Thank you, Wendy.[A]
[0384]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]What are you doing,
Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm practicing my walking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Walking?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For an Armor Knight, it's tough
to get back up if you fall to[A]
the ground.[A]
You have to build strong legs to
make sure that you will never fall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The basics are everything, Oujay.[A]
[0385]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! Ha![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD]Oujay, are you doing practice
swings with your sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I can't be losing to you, so I thought
I'd retrain myself the basics also.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
But,
I won't lose to you either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose we've got a
little competition going, then.[A]
[0386]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]How are you doing, Wendy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm doing well, of course.[A]
I can't be complaining if I want
to be a strong Armor Knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, me too.
If I want to be a powerful mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oujay, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been able to keep trying
because I'm competing with you.[A]
If I didn't have you with me, I
probably would have given up, sayingア[A]
'It wouldn't have been possible
for a girl anyway.'[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I feel the same way.[A]
I've been able to come this far
thanks to you.[A]
We're even.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
But I still won't allow myself
to lose to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll throw those words right
back at you, Wendy![A]
[0387]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Oh...[A]
You're Sir Bors' younger sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you doing back here?[A]
With your light gear,
you should be far ahead of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Sorry.[A]
Your legs and back don't really
work the way you want them to[A]
when you're my age...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Sir Asthor,
just how old are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoo, scary...[A]
You're even more serious than
your brother.[A]
And you're even built like him.[A]
What a shame for a girl of your
age to be so f-[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not fat!
This is my armor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]O-Okay, okay.
Just calm down...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A-Anyway...[A]
Try to learn from
my brother a little more.[A]
[0388]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Wendy.
How are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Sir Asthor...[A]
What are you doing relaxing
here like this...[A]
This is a battlefield![A]
Please be more serious![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, there is no point in
getting too fired up for nothing.[A]
Come on, let's take it easy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You won't get away today.[A]
I'll drag you away if I
have to![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woah...[A]
Hey,
wait a minute...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Asthor...[A]
That wound...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Don't worry about it.[A]
It's just an old scar.[A]
I can't do much with this
leg because of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]When...did you get that wound?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...
A long time ago.[A]
I kinda messed up when I snuck
into Bern's castle on a mission.[A]
I managed to get away, so I guess it's
a scar of honor, so to speak.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...[A]
I'm sorry!
I didn't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, so I told
you not to worry about it...[A]
[0389]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1BD][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Asthor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wendy.
Beautiful as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can't flatter me like that.
I understand about your leg.[A]
But!
I still have a lot to tell you![A]
First,
about your drinking habits...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh damn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, you're not getting away.[A]
You shall behave like a proper
Ostian knight from now on![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh...[A]
[038A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Mildain...!
What is wrong!?[A]
Your eyes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That voice...
Is it Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you not see, your Highness?
I thought your eyes had recovered...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still temporarily go
blind sometimes...[A]
I will be fine once I rest
for a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I heard that the side effects
of the poison had blinded you for[A]
several months...[A]
Forgive me, my prince...[A]
If only I had been on my guard,
you would never have suffered this[A]
horrible fate...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I wonder how...
my father is doing.[A]
Is he still in the same state?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I regret to say that he
is, Your Highness.[A]
He does not know of your
safety yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]But I am sure the life will return to
him when you return to the palace in[A]
one piece, Prince Mildain.[A]
He will recover...
and so will our nation.[A]
[038B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My prince,[A]
the balance of power on this continent
has been changing drastically due[A]
to General Roy's tactics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...so it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It will not be long before this
army conquers the entire continent.[A]
I believe that would be the perfect time to
announce your succession to the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas...
about that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Prince Mildain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have hesitations about
returning to Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying!?[A]
Our people are all anxious
about your safety...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas.[A]
After I went to the Western Isles and
joined the rebels, I learned much.[A]
Too much, in fact.[A]
I witnessed innocent civilians being treated
like animals under corrupt Etrurian landlords.[A]
If I hadn't been caught up in the
assassination, I probably never would[A]
have known.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then that is all the more reason to use
that experience to fix those problems...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I promise I will return to
the palace.[A]
But...[A]
Right now, I want to be with
the people and watch over them.[A]
[038C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Mildain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.[A]
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.[A]
You don't mind that just for
now, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]
Then I shall pledge my loyalty to you as
another human being, not as a general.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is ever so
hard to bend your ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My unbending will is my strength.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This war will end soon.[A]
General Roy is still young,
but he understands the people.[A]
He will lead not only Etruria, but the
whole continent to a Gilded Age of peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I should do something as well,
don't you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall accompany you
wherever you go.[A]
[038D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Geese.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey...
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to thank you for
what you've done.[A]
I understand that you safely
escorted Pr-[A]
...I mean, Elphin to the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah,
I did what I could.[A]
That bard was an interesting guy.[A]
The girl he was with was seasick
the whole time, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...
Geese, I must apologize.[A]
I've misjudged you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since the assassins were after Elphin,
I couldn't put him on a large scale ship.[A]
That would be the first place they would
look.[A]
So I had to ask you.[A]
But I can't say that I fully trusted you,
a pirate.[A]
However, you kept your word.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey...
No problem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have turned him over to the Coup
d'etat forces and gotten a hefty reward.[A]
Why did you choose to help him?[A]
It didn't make you any money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, saving people makes
you feel good afterwards.[A]
Piracy sure as hell doesn't.[A]
[038E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese,
I must give you some kind of reward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reward?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have been a great help
to our country.[A]
I can give you anything
you ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What're you talking about...
I already got my payment you promised me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...
That is not a sufficient reward.[A]
You are a hero to the Etrurian people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hero?
That guy's just a bard, right?[A]
Well, I was surprised when he turned out
to be the liberator of the Western Isles...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...
I must tell you something...[A]
......
...Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry.
I cannot tell you yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Geez...
Make up your mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway...[A]
I hear that you have helped
the Western people as well.[A]
Both our king and prince
had wished them to be freed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Sorry, but I don't really give a damn about
politics or other nations' statures or[A]
anything like that.[A]
I just wanted to do something for
the village that helped me out.[A]
[038F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
You have done me a great favor.[A]
It would be dishonoring my
family's name if I didn't return it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man,
you knights are so hard-headed.[A]
I swear, if you found gold on the
street, you wouldn't dare pocket it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh....
Fine, let me think...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...All right, here's what I want.[A]
I want you and your king to
make your country a good one.[A]
Make it a nation that won't go
around causing stupid wars.[A]
And make it a nation where people can
travel and do business safely.[A]
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you don't
do that for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...Geese...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You deserve much better
than being a pirate.[A]
I will promise to fulfill
your requests.[A]
I shall swear my life to them![A]
[0390]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me.[A]
Are you Lord Douglas
of Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you are the
Great General?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am but a simple soldier now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
I am Igrene,
guardian of Arcadia, in Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I fend off invaders in
the desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
And do you need something from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish for you to promise me never
to attack Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I cannot promise you that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?

[OpenMidLeft]We are knights...[A]
If the king orders an attack,
we must obey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you know it to be wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is part of being a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0391]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas,
about the other day...[A]
Can you promise as a nation
never to attack Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But you have so much wealth...
Why can you not promise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Things can happen even
without the king's orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria is a huge country supported by
various families of nobility.[A]
Not all nobles are kind at heart.[A]
If such nobles take over the court,
there is nothing the king or I can do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what is there to gain
in a desert like Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not about gain...
They simply want to show their power.[A]
They do not feel their worth unless
they have someone to step on.[A]
I hear that the people in the West
suffered from similar power abuse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0392]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it,
Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I said this before,
but as an Etrurian General,[A]
I cannot promise you what you ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, I will do my best to
fulfill your request.[A]
I shall spread the word that among the
heroes who rescued the king were warriors[A]
from Nabata.[A]
I shall persuade the nobles never
to disturb your peace in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I shall remember those words.[A]
I suppose that is all I can ask of
you now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[A]
[0393]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidRight]Percival.[A]
We fight together again.[A]
Though it looks like this time
I am fighting in shame.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please, Lord Douglas.[A]
You only did your duty as an Etrurian
General.[A]
There is nothing to be ashamed about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We are honored to be able
fight by your side once again.[A]
I'm sure the other Etrurians among
us feel the same way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you...[A]
Your words are encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let us fight together
for the future of Etruria![A]
[0394]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival,
how do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I could be doing better.
How about you, Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am trying my best, but...[A]
It seems I am losing the strength
I used to have.[A]
I suppose I cannot beat my age.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nonsense.[A]
You are living up to the title of
the Great General, Lord Douglas.[A]
You still have a long ways to go yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is there something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No,
that's not the case...[A]
[0395]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Percival.[A]
It might be a bit early to say
this, but..[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am thinking of retiring as the
Great General after this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
Then the highest position in the
Etrurian military would be empty![A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you...
to take my place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am still young, Lord Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are young?
Then what about our commander, Roy?[A]
He is much younger than you,
and he is leading all of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The youths will not grow if old
veterans keep hogging their positions.[A]
Percival, you are intelligent, strong
and a fine leader.[A]
Besides, once the prince returns, the
king will step down from the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Douglas![A]
Those in service must not talk about
the inheritance of the throne...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is all right.[A]
I have been serving the king
for decades now.[A]
I know him better than anybody.[A]
I am sure once he learns of the prince's
survival, he will give the throne to him[A]
without hesitation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.[A]
Etruria will be reborn again with
the help from you young ones.[A]
I will be counting on you, Percival.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I shall swear my life to it.[A]
[0396]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why didn't you tell me?[A]
I knew you were alive, but I never
thought you were here with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
Here I am, living in shame.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nonsense!
You are a great asset to us all.[A]
It is an honor to fight alongside
you once again.[A]
Let us show the continent the
power of the Etrurian Generals![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
It's not like you to be so confident,
Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My courage is coming from you.[A]
You've always been my goal,
and you still are.[A]
[0397]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The former Sorcery General wanted
you as his successor...[A]
But it looked like you had many
enemies at first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I won't deny that.[A]
Being a female general was enough
to turn people against me.[A]
I spent most of my earlier days
fighting against prejudice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To be honest, I was unsure
of your abilities at first, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
Every time you saidア[A]
'You're weak, you don't know
how to fight.'[A]
I would bury my nose in spell
books all night.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's just like you.[A]
Well, it's no wonder you were
holding a grudge against me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
I never held a grudge against you,
Lord Douglas.[A]
Do you remember that time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The day I enlisted, the other young
generals were teasing me about my gender.[A]
But you defended me, sayingア
'She's stronger than you all.'[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm afraid I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's all right.
I remember perfectly.[A]
[0398]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must thank you.[A]
You've helped out an old,
worthless soldier like me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...
What are you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whenever I fight,
I can feel my age.[A]
Aged soldiers are of no use.
My time has ended.[A]
It is now up to you to lead
Etruria to a bright future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I've never heard you say something
so stupid, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]A bright future for Etruria?
You can talk about that after we win.[A]
Even if we do win this war, we have
much to worry about.[A]
We must rebuild our land and regain
other nations' trust.[A]
Etruria's future comes...
after all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you're going to put all that responsibility
on us, while you take it easy?[A]
I don't think so, Lord Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You really have grown
more confident.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is thanks to you.[A]
Now, if you feel defeated,
why don't you be of some use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...very well.[A]
I suppose I can't be outdone by
you amateurs yet.[A]
Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, Lord Douglas.[A]

[ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I mean, Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry, it is all right for people
here to know our relationship.[A]
We don't have many chances to speak in
private like this.[A]
Just call me your father, as you
always do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father...
You don't look well.[A]
Are you okay?
Do you feel sick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not sick.
I'm just a little tired.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can I help?[A]
I'll do anything for you, Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lalum...
It's all right.[A]
I feel better now after

You can go now...
there's no need to worry.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see.
Thank you very much, Lalum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teehee...

[OpenMidLeft]What, right here?[A]
I don't think a military general should be

middle of a battle...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lalum...
It's the feeling that counts.[A]
Your consideration is enough
encouragement.[A]
You don't have to stress yourself

[OpenMidRight]I'm not stressing myself![A]
If you look sad,

But if you're laughing,

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have something I must
ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Something to ask of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, could you...[A]
Please, could you teach me
how to use a sword?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...[A]
May I ask why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can only use bows.[A]
An archer is done for if he gets
ambushed in close range.[A]
I wouldn't be able to protect
Master Roy if that happens...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true.[A]
There are certain things that
can be done only with a bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Besides, is there much point in learning
swordplay now, at your late age?[A]
Mediocre skill would do nothing
but hinder Master Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[A]
You are being a great help
to Master Roy already.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wonder...[A]
[039D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
I can tell by your face that you
still want me to teach you swordplay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just don't get it.[A]
Am I really being of that much
help to Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
What do you think of us as
Lord Eliwood's knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Eh...?
Well...[A]
You're all really strong,
and I look up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that's nice to hear.[A]
Still, there is one problem
with us being Eliwood's knights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of us are even
close to his age.[A]
[OpenMidRight]![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood's vassals...[A]
They were all old like me or far
younger than him.[A]
He had no one to joke around with, no
one to talk about his concerns with.[A]
He was always fighting on his own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Always on his own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't want Master Roy to suffer
the same fate.[A]
You and Master Roy are the same age,
and what's more, you are milk brothers.[A]
So I want you to stay by Master Roy's
side and give him moral support.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Moral support?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
Fighting well in battle is important,
but that is not all that is necessary[A]
to show your loyalty.[A]
Think about it.[A]
[039E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10B][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wolt.[A]
You don't look so troubled for
a change.[A]
Well, do you still want me to
teach you how to wield a sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, after hearing your words, I cast
away my hesitation.[A]
I will perfect my skills with my bow,
and I will train myself so that Roy[A]
can count on me without doubt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]
With that attitude, it looks like
I can let you take over for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
B-But if you leave now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Calm down, I didn't say right at
this minute.[A]
Still, it won't be that far away.[A]
Once I am gone, you must take care
of Master Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps taking after an old man
like me would be embarrassing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, that's not it...[A]
It's just that...
can I really do it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There now, see?
You have to fix your lack of confidence.[A]
You will worry Master Roy with an
attitude like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can do it.
Have confidence in yourself![A]

Don't you feel the size of this
